TERMS OF USE
There's usually a lot of legalese here but what it would probably boil down to is:

[1] This is free, not GNU. The "Powered By" notice must remain visible. Make changes to the code if that floats your boat, but the notice stays ;)

[2] No guarantees, no liability - install this at your own risk. It's not designed for a superheavy load of traffic, your CPU rate may spike with heavy use. Updates with patches will be available as and when. The creator is also not liable for the use this script is put to.

SUPPORT
None guaranteed, but there is a forum at http://www.alter-idem.com/forum/ where you can post with any issues.


Peace
