<br>
An explanation of all the lovely settings.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sitename">Sitename</a></b><br>
<br>
Shows in the title bar and a few other places.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="slogan">Site Slogan</a></b><br>
<br>
Shows in the title bar. Not really required, but looks nice.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="url">Site URL</a></b><br>
<br>
The URL for the site. This is used in a few places, such as e-mails that are sent 
out.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="siteemail">Site E-mail</a></b><br>
<br>
The main e-mail address for the site. Most e-mails that are sent show this address 
as the from and reply to address.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="databasepath">Database Config Path</a></b><br>
<br>
This is the direct server path for the folder where the database login and password 
reside (dbconfig.php). For security reasons, it's a good idea to put it outside 
of your html directory where it can't be easily accessed. <br>
<br>
<hr>
<b><br>
<a name="storiespath">Stories Path</a></b><br>
<br>
This is the direct server path for the folder where the stories folder is located. 
This is only applicable if &quot;How to Store Stories&quot; is set to &quot;files&quot;. 
Most of the time, you can just set this setting to &quot;stories&quot; (no quotes).<br>
<br>
<hr>
<b><br>
<a name="tableprefix">Table Prefix</a></b><br>
<br>
It is possible to run multiple instances of the script off of one database, by 
setting the table prefix during install (this causes whatever prefix you set to 
be appended to the beginning of the tables, i.e. <i>prefix_</i>fanfiction_authors). 
You must indicate that prefix here in the settings.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><a name="storing">How to Store Stories</a></b><br>
<br>
You have a choice about how to store the text of the stories. Both ways have their 
pros and cons:<br>
<br>
MySQL: This doesn't require writing to the server, and if safe-mode is on, then 
this is really your only option. If you have a lot of stories, though, it can 
really fill up your database and make things run slowly. <br>
<br>
Files: This choice will store the text of the stories to .txt files on the server, 
in the stories folder. Safe-mode must be off for this to occur. This will take 
up less server and mySQL resources.<br>
<br>
Regardless of which you go with, pick one and stay with it! Changing to a new 
mode will completely mess up your archive, as the stories stored in the old way 
will not display with the new setting.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="validate">Validate all stories</a></b><br>
<br>
Setting this to yes, means that stories submitted to the archive will not be moderated 
in any way. Setting it to no makes it so that stories submitted by unvalidated 
authors are put in the queue to be reviewed by an admin.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="numcats">Number of Categories</a></b><br>
<br>
If you have only one category, you should set this to "Only One". Doing so will 
create shortcuts in a few areas of the site, where category selection is required 
when there are more than one category.<br>
<br>
<hr>
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial"><br>
  <b><a name="catscolumn">Number of Category Columns</a></b><br>
  <br>
  The number of columns when displaying the categories on categories.php and index.php. 
  The code will insert a &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; into the code, so that the categories 
  will start to print onto the next row. Note that your skin must be using tables 
  for the categories display, and must have the {<font face="Arial"><font color="#000000">categorycolumn} 
  attribute input in the appropriate place for this to work.</font></font><br>
  <br>
  </font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="newscomments">Turn on News Comments</a></b><br>
  <br>
  Allows people to make comments to news stories. You must be sure to include 
  the appropriate attribute in the newsbox.tpl file (the attribu<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">te 
  is </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#800080">{newscomments}</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">) 
  for people to be able to click and then add a comment.</font> </p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="favorites">Allow Favorites</a></b><br>
  <br>
  Allows members to list their favorite stories and authors under viewuser.php.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="numupdated">Number of Updated Stories</a></b><br>
  <br>
  Sets the number of recently updated stories listed on the index page.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="dateformat">Date Format Stories/News</a></b><br>
  <br>
  Sets the date formats used in several places on the site. Story blocks can have 
  a different date format than the news items. Should you not like any of the 
  date formats listed, take a look at the file called timefunctions.php. You can 
  modify one of the settings to display in whatever format you want there.</font> 
</p>
<hr>
<font face="Arial"><br>
<b><a name="reviews">Turn on Reviews</a></b><br>
<br>
Reviews, of course, allow for people to submit public reviews that stay permanently 
on the site (readers can also submit personal reviews through an e-mail form).<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font face="Arial"> 
<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="anonreviews">Anonymous Reviews</a></b><br><br>

This only applies if reviews are turned on, of course. Setting this to yes allows readers
to submit reviews without being logged in.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="ratings">Ratings System</a></b><br><br>

This only applies if reviews are turned on. Readers can only submit a rating if
they submit a review. You can turn this off, or turn it to stars (one through 5 stars),
or a like/dislike setting.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="roundrobins">Round Robins</a></b><br><br>

Round robins are stories in which multiple people can add to it. If you don't want
people submitting this kind of story, be sure to turn this setting off.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="submissions">No Unsolicited Submissions</a></b><br><br>

Essentially, what this means is that no one can submit a fanfiction to your
archive. Only you as the admin would be able to add fics. This will turn off the Login link, so 
that people can not create new accounts or login.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="itemspage">Default Items Per Page</a></b><br><br>

The number of items per page that display when people search, or a list of stories
display.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="uploads">Allow Image Uploads</a></b><br><br>

If you'd like people to have the ability to upload images to include with their
stories, set this to yes. The images are stored in each author's folder in the stories 
folder.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="maximage">Max Image Width & Height</a></b><br><br>

These only apply if image uploads is set to on. The max size is set in pixels.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="layout">Default Skin</a></b><br><br>

This is the skin that will show to non-members or guests just browsing the site. <br><br>

<hr><br><br>


<b><a name="welcome">Front Page Message</a></b><br><br>

This is the welcome message displayed on your index page. You can essentially use this
to say whatever you want, or highlight stories, or whatever.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="rules">Submission Rules</a></b><br><br>

Your submission rules. You may use html here.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="thankyou">Thank You Letter</a></b><br><br>

Your default acceptance letter for fics. This prevents you having to write the same thing
over and over every time you accept a fic into the archive. You can edit it when you
validate the fic.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="nothankyou">No Thank You Letter</a></b><br><br>

Your default refusal letter for fics. This prevents you having to write the same thing
over and over every time you refuse a fic. You can edit it when you
delete the fic.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="copyright">Copyright Footer</a></b><br><br>

This will display at the bottom of every page. You can leave it blank if you so choose.<br><br>

<hr><br><br>

<b><a name="help">Help Text</a></b><br><br>

This is the text for the Help page, although you could theoretically use it for anything 
you wanted. <br><br>
