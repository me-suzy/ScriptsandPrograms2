  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basic Installation
    Instructions:</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you know basic
    web stuff like CHMODing, look below at step #1. If you have no clue what you're
    doing, just go to http://www.yoursite.com/install.php after uploading all
    the files to your server.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) CHMOD the stories
    folder to 777 if you intend to write the story texts to the server or allow
    image uploads.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) CHMOD config.php
    to 666</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Modify data/dbconfig.php
    with the appropriate MySQL database info, and put outside the web directory.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) Run install.php</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) Login with the
    admin login and password set in step #4, and set your settings.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The stuff below is
    explanations for certain steps done during the install.php procedure.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>PHP.INI<a name="php"></a></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The php.ini file is
    not something that most people have access to if they're using shared webhosting
    (which most people are). It is the config file for PHP, and modifying it would
    affect everyone who is on the server -- so your webhost must be the ones to
    modify it. Sometimes they can be sticky about changing certain settings, especially
    safe_mode. So, if they won't turn it on for you, you must either live with
    safe_mode being on and lose some of the functionality of the script, OR find
    a host that runs PHP with safe_mode off (of which there are many). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note: one of the requirements
    of the script is that register_globals be set to on. The recent versions of
    PHP, when installed, have register_globals set to off as the default. If the
    install script is telling you that register_globals is off, contact your web
    host, and ask them to set it to on. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>CHMODing</b><a name="chmod"></a></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CHMODing means that
    you are changing the permissions of a file. Basically, a file has read, write,
    or execute permissions for Owner, Group, and Other. You have to set the read,
    write, and execute permissions correctly for these three groups so that they
    add up to 666 (for config.php -- this would be read and write for all 3 groups)
    or 777 (for the stories folder -- read, write, and execute for all three groups).
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In most FTP programs,
    you select the file or folder in question, and right click on it. You should
    see a choice there that says &quot;CHMOD&quot; or &quot;Permissions&quot;.
    Choose that, and you should see some sort of interface to change the permissions
    (usually little checkboxes that you turn on or off). If you're still stuck
    on how to do this, come ask in the Orodruin forums for more info.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Database Info</b><a name="dbinfo"></a></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is going to be
    the hard part for people who are not used to working with MySQL databases.
    If you're using shared webhosting, then you probably have some sort of control
    panel interface that comes with your hosting. Do some poking around in there,
    and see if you can't find a place that mentions either &quot;MySQL&quot; or
    &quot;databases.&quot; You need to create a database, that has both a database
    login, and password associated with it. Once you've done that, you can modify
    the dbconfig.php file with that information. If you're still not able to figure
    out how to do this, it's best to talk to your webhost and ask for help.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Installing the
    Tables</b><a name="tables"></a></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The database must
    have several tables installed where all the script information is stored (i.e.
    the users, the stories, and everything else). The script can install these
    tables for you, and there's really no reason not to have it do that. If you're
    concerned about it doing that, you can use the tables.sql file (found in the
    docs folder) and run them yourself -- you should only do this if you know
    what you're doing.</font></p>
