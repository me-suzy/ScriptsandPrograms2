StoryStream 0.3.2 - Beta - 11/20/2005

************
Overview
************
StoryStream is a formalized, collaborative hyperfiction system that allows users to 
create,extend and rate hierarchical or other text/media based art forms.  Written in 
PHP and using MySQL (by default) as a back-end database, StoryStream can be run on 
any number of hosts all over the world.   StoryStream hopes to be a tool for 
channeling creativity on the web while being a source of entertainment and fun. You
can use a working StoryStream site here: http://www.storystream.org

Installation
************
Requirements: 
- PHP 4.4.x
- MySQL 4.x 
- Tested on Apache and IIS

1. Create a new database with an appropriate name in your MySQL server 
	(or use an existing one).  
	IMPORTANT: The installation script will overwrite existing tables with the same name
		so do not use an existing StoryStream installation if you wish to reuse the 
		data.  You must manually create the dbconfig.php file in the config directory and
		point it to your existing data.
	
2. Go to the site via web client.  You will be redirected to the install directory
    
3. Enter the database information and click 'Install'.  Note that there are three things
	that are done during install:
		a. Database tables created and populated
		b. dbconfig.php file in config/ directory is created
		c. Permissions on include/smarty/templates_c directory are set to writable.
		
	If any of these things fail during install, you will be given an error message. You
	can continue to run the install script until you have no more error messages.  Sometimes
	the script cannot set the permissions of a file due to security restrictions setup
	by your webhost - that means that you have to do the permissions setting yourself.  To do 
	so, simply open your ftp client and navigate to the storystream directory.  Now find the
	'config' and set the permissions to 0777 (or drwxrwxrwx).  Do the same for the 
	'include/smarty/templates_c' directory.  Now rerun the installer script and everything should
	work correctly.  
	
	IMPORTANT: For security reasons, you should set the config directory back to read-only AND
		delete the install directory. 

4. Login as 'admin' with password 'password1'. 

Note: The FAQ code has not been included in this distribution.  The 
test StoryStream site uses ODFAQ which can found here: 
http://www.oodie.com/project/odfaq/.  As long as your FAQ is located in 
a folder called 'faq' off the root of the storystream site, there won't
be any broken links in the default theme.

Note2: StoryStream assumes that your webserver includes 'index.php' as 
one of the default pages.
