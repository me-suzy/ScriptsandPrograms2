Update from v2.x.xxx to v2.2.178

Install TOPo in a new directory of the server and then copy all the files of old DATA directory except INC_CONFIG.PHP to DATA directory of the new TOPo install directory.
For example, if you have two folders in the server:
	/TOPo_old
	/TOPo_new
copy all the files of /TOPo_old/data/ to a directory called c:/BACKUP in your local hard disk, then delete INC_CONFIG.PHP file of the c:/BACKUP directory and upload the others files to /TOPo_new/data/ directory of your server overwriting the existing ones and setting file permissions of all files that you upload to 666 (or 777).


Update from v1.x to v2.x.xxx

TOPo v2.x.xxx database is INCOMPATIBLE with TOPo v1.x series.
A converter script from v1.x -> v2.x.xxx is available in CONTROL PANEL -> TOOLs menu.
