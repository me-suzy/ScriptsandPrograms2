The script will be optimized after installation for using as TopList or Directory.

<h4>Integration with existing site</h4>
GB Top-Directory is script for independent sites, but you can also integrate it in your existing site.
There are two ways: installing in subdirectory and in main directory.
<br><br>
Subdirectory installation is simplest choice for independent Toplist(Directory).
You don't need to do any changes in settings, but you can count traffic in this subdirectory only.
Your must have some traffic on index page of your directory(toplist) which will start script spiders and automatic updating of lists.
This mode is good choice for independent TopLists and simple links pages without regular backlink&backwards checkers.
<br><br>
Installation in main directory is highly recommended for any sites,
especially if your need to include the lists in any pages or to count incoming traffic from any page of your site
or if your need regular backlink&backwards checkers.
<br><br>
<b>Main directory installation - method 1:</b> Using of php function include in templates.<br>
You need to rename existing index page of your site in 'page.html' (or any other name, but not index)
and insert into template of main page (header or footer) this html-code:<br>
<TEXTAREA ROWS=2 COLS=50>
<?include('page.html')?>
</TEXTAREA>
<br><br>
<b>Main directory installation - method 2:</b> The best, but for php-sites only.<br>
Rename index.php file of the script in 'top.php' (or any other name, but not index)
and insert this code into index.php page of your existing site (code must be placed in the beginning of index.php page):<br>
<TEXTAREA ROWS=2 COLS=50>
<?$noface=1;include('top.php');?>
</TEXTAREA>
<br>
This code will be track incoming hits. You can use this code at any php-page for hits tracking.
And now you can integrate the lists in any php-page of your site using include function.
This example code will include the list additional.html:
<br>
<TEXTAREA ROWS=2 COLS=50>
<?include('additional.html')?>
</TEXTAREA>
