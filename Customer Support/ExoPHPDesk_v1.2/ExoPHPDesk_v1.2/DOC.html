            <b>Customization<br>
            <br>
            </b> </i></u><i>Adding A Sub Page With Same Header And Footer:<u><b><br>
            </b></u></i>Move the file sub_page.php from extras directory to the 
            main directory, rename it to anything you want. Consult the comments 
            included in the file for more information.<i><u><b><br>
            <br>
            </b></u></i><i>Change Ranks Images<br>
            </i>To change the rank images, you will need to create 5 images. Name 
            them as they are named ago, copy/replace them to directory tpl/YOURTEMPLATE/images/.<br>
            <br>
            <i><u> <b>Templates<br>
            <br>
            </b> </u></i>If you need to edit/create your own templates, just keep 
            the variables used over there. Variables in templates exist like in 
            the following example:<u><i><b><br>
            </b> </i></u>{VARIABLE} OR ^VARIABLE^&nbsp; (These aren't actual variables, 
            though they are referred as variables. )<br>
            Keep in mind that if you are using a new variable, define it in lang_*.php. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There are two types of subs we used in the templates:<br>
            1. &lt;!-EX-!&gt; **** &lt;/!-EX-&gt; <br>
            2. [#ex **** /#ex]<br>
            <br>
            First one is named as Block and second one is just a sub part of a 
            template. Both of the above mentioned should be unchanged. <br>
            <br>
            There is function usage in the template as &lt;#functionName()/#&gt; 
            . They are also an important and shouldn't be edited unless you know 
            what you are doing.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, we have used logic statements as :<br>
            &lt;if*&gt;<br>
            if( &quot;{foo}&quot; == &quot;bar&quot; )<br>
            {<br>
            <br>
            foooooooo<br>
            <br>
            }<br>
            &lt;/if*&gt;<br>
            <br>
            Try not to edit the part you dont understand. Well if its HTML then 
            you can edit it anyways.<br>
            <u><b><i><br>
            </i></b></u>We recommend to copy the old templates to a new folder 
            and then Edit each file that needs to be edited, this will be a lot 
            easy then and it will be more likely that you won't miss any required 
            variable.<br>
