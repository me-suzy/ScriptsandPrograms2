## BEFORE YOU INSTALL #####################################################

1. Unzip the Evaria Mail Client (EMAIL) and open /admin/config.inc.php 
in a text-editor. (We use CoffeeCup but Notepad should serve you well...)
Fill in all the variables, most of them are self-explanatory, but
all are described so this should only be boring, not difficult c",

2. Upload all files and directories (except this file) 
to your server. CHMOD the following directory:

/udloads/                           -->           777

## THE INSTALLATION #######################################################

1. That's it, you're already finished!!!

## THE MODIFICATION #######################################################

1. Here comes the fun bit ! To change the look and feel simply edit the 
two style sheets found in /style/ and edit index.php to fit your design.
You may also want to edit /admin/contact.inc, but don't mess with the code
or the script may stop responding the way you want...

2. Do not rename or delete the images and graphics in /img/ and /graphic/ 
as they are needed partly to accompany the EMAIL, but feel free to replace.

3. When you upload a file you'll see that it's renamed, this is to prevent 
losing a file due to identical name. The new name is unique and based on 
current time when it was uploaded.

4. Can't think of anything else for the moment, but please use our support
forum at http://forum.evaria.com to post your concerns, tips and requests.
