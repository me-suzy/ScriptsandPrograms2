1) Set all your information in the "config.php" file.
2) Upload the "contactMe" folder to your webserver space.
3) Just link to: www.yoursite.com/php/contactMe/contactMe.htm 
4) To view log file go to: www.yoursite.com/php/contactMe/ipLog.htm


NOTE: You will have to set the "ipLog.htm" files' permission to 
writable inorder for the script to write the IP address to the log.


Product support: NONE...This script is distributed as is! Do NOT alter the
code in any file other that "config.php" unless you know what you are doing!
Do NOT rename ANY file or code will not work correctly! You may alter the
look of the HTML (hardcoded or generated) pages as you wish.
