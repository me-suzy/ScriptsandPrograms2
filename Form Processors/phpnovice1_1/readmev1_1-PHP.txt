		(1A) Set the variable values in nvform.php as follows. 
                           ===========================

*** For added privacy and security the $sendto and $ccto reply emails are set in the actual 
nvform.php script, preventing un-authorized person(s) from using your script to post 
their own forms to send spam. 

-----------------------------
$sendto


$sendto is the email address the data from form submissions will be sent to,

Example:
$sendto = "sendto@yourdomain.com";

-----------------------------
$ccto


$ccto is the email address the data from form submissions can be carbon copied to.
If you don't want to carbon copy the data to a second email just ignore this, and leave blank.

Example:
$ccto = "ccto@yourdomain.com";

    O P T I O N A L   V A R I A B L E S

$setokurl

to use $okurls to verify the URL the form is submitted by; set $setokurl = "1"; and 
set $setokurl = "0"; if you do not want to use $okurls to verify form submission URL.
Example:
$setokurl = "0"; /* WOULD NOT REQUIRE URL VALIDATION */
$setokurl = "1"; /* WOULD REQUIRE URL VALIDATION */

Only web address's entered below will be allowed to process the form if 
$setokurl = "1";

$okurls = "http://www.yourdomain.com,http://yourdomain.com,34.344.344.344";

<!-----  "sort" is another optional field and SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE FORM if 
you want to sort the field order in the results email you will receive.
You can also leave fields out of the form by not including them in this field.
If using this option, enter all the fields you want to be added to the results 
email starting with the first you want to apear and ending with the last you want
to appear and separate each field with a coma. 
Example:  value="email,firstname,lastname,phone"   ----->

<!--- NOTE: The date and IP Address will automatically be added to the top of every
form and does not need to be configured in the sort field.

<!----- THE "email" FIELD IS A FIELD THAT IS OPTIONAL. HOWEVER CAN BE USED TO SPECIFY POSTERS EMAIL. --->
