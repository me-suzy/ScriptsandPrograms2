	INTRODUCTION

	This script converts user-entered 12-hour time to the 24-hour 
	time used by mySQL.  I assume you have basic knowledge of PHP and
	mySQL.


	BEFORE YOU BEGIN

	This script was written for use with PHP and mySQL.  It assumes 
	you have a table with a uniqueid.  A sample table is included
	in sampletable.sql

	
	FORM VARIABLES

	To make this script as easy as possible to use, I have coded
	default variables on lines 56,57 and 58.  These variables are
	used throughout the script to minimize any errors.

	
	FORM ACTION

	This form is set to post to itself - automatically updating
	after each submit.


	LAYOUT AND DESIGN

	I have included HTML coding to assist you with adding your
	own layout and design to the document.


	CONCLUSION

	I hope you find this script useful in your form creations.  Feel
	free to send your feedback to scripts@sunfrogservices.com.
