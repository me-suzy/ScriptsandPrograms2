~~~~~~~~~~~
Background:
~~~~~~~~~~~
I've been asked many times for an addition to my shoutcast stats script that will allow visitors to the stats to also request songs. Well here's that very system.
I presume most people who use Internet Radio use playlists, so setup is very simple.

~~~~~~
Setup:
~~~~~~
Open config.php and add the name of your playlist (playlists must be in .m3u format and you must include this) to the variable $playlist
Example:

$playlist = "all.m3u";

Now just upload the playlist with this script, and that's it, your done.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
How It Works:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We filter out all the information in the .m3u file that we don't need such as song path and tags
Then we load this into a text file, so we have a text version of your playlist including html select tags, this is called playlist.txt

Playlist.txt is then loaded inbetween form and listbox tags, creating the form full of songs you should see on the page.
Selected songs are then submitted to another text file named chosen.txt that is then displayed on the screen.

What you may want in the future:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Intergtation into shoutcast stats to delete songs from the list once they have been played
