1. PURPOSE - Brief Explanation, Advantages, and Limitations
	spiderLog v1.1 is a simple guestbook.  Users may add entries.  Entries are stored directly in the guestbook Web page.  The owner can easily customize the layout and design of the guestbook and remove entries.  v1.1 prevents users from using the guestbook to advertise other Web sites.
	v1.1 no longer collects e-mail addresses from users to protect them against data mining.

2. REQUIREMENTS - Necessary Software and Server Access
	PHP must be installed on your Web server.  You must be able to set file permissions.

3. INSTALLATION - Step-by-Step
	(1) Download and unzip spiderlog.zip.  You should now have the following files:
		* sign.html
		* sign.php
		* guestbook.html
	NOTE: You may rename these files.  However, if you rename guestbook.html, you must change the corresponding variable in sign.php.
	(2) Upload the files.
	(3) CHMOD guestbook.xml 666 (read and write).
	(4) You should finish by testing your new guestbook.

4. CUSTOMIZATION
