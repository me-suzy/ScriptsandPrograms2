<p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GuestBookHost 
  Installation Instructions</font></b></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Okay, let's just 
  dive right in. The first thing you'll need to do is configure your MySQL settings. 
  Open <b>config.php</b> in Notepad or another text editor. The first 4 variables 
  ($sqlhost, $sqllogin, $sqlpass, $sqldb) need to be configured with your MySQL 
  settings. These settings are your MySQL Hostname, Username, Password, and Database 
  Name. The other three variables are the table names to be created, and can be 
  left as they are unless you really need to change them.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Save <b>config.php</b> 
  and upload it to the root of your website. Also upload <b>create_tables.php</b> 
  to the same place. Now access your website through your browser, and access 
  /create_tables.php. You'll be prompted with further instructions from there.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, let's open 
  <b>config.php</b> again. The next set of variables to be edit, are right under 
  the MySQL settings.<b><br>
  $adminpass</b> needs to be set to a password you'll remember. This is used when 
  accessing admin.php.<b><br>
  $signup_filename, $edit_filename</b> and <b>$guestbook_filename</b> should be 
  left as they are unless you really need to rename signup.php, edit.php and gb.php.<b><br>
  $gbtitle</b> will be the name of your guestbook service. You may call it GuestBookHost 
  if you wish, or you may use the name of your own existing website.<br>
  <b>$gburl</b> should point to the URL where GuestBookHost is located. This is 
  used in several places in the script, an is given to a guestbook owner in their 
  HTML code when they sign up.<b><br>
  $purgedays</b> -- This is for the Inactive Account Pruning feature. The script 
  can automatically delete accounts that have never had any posts in the last 
  xx days.<br>
  <b>$gb_popwin_width / $gb_popwin_height</b> - The script gives javascript code 
  to the user for displaying their guestbook on their site. These settings specify 
  the window size when displaying their guestbook. These settings are also used 
  in the Member Area when previewing the guestbook.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Appearance and Design Variables<br>
  </b>These settings are used to configure how GuestBookHost will look, and apply 
  mostly only to the signup and edit pages. The first two, <b>$headerfile</b> 
  and <b>$footerfile</b> will hold the HTML that appears at the top and bottom 
  (and sides, if you're using tables) of the signup.php and edit.php pages. Some 
  code has already been put into these files, and you may change them any way 
  you'd like, just keep one thing in mind: Notice the PHP code between &lt;title&gt; 
  and &lt;/title&gt;. That code needs to appear in your template in order for 
  the page titles to be automatically inserted. The rest of the variables in this 
  section decide the font name/size, table cell text color, background color, 
  table properties, page titles, button texts, etc. The default settings should 
  be okay, but I would suggest you change the colors to anything you'd like. ;)<br>
  <br>
  </font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Example 
  index.php Page<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An example 
  main page has been included. This page is JUST AN EXAMPLE of how you could design 
  your main page for this service, and how to include the create links to the 
  edit and signup pages. Again, keep in mind, this file is just an example, however 
  you may use it and customize it in an HTML editor if you wish. :)</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Multiple Post 
  Blocking<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
  feature won't take long to explain. The script doesn't allow a poster to post 
  a message on a guestbook more than once a day <i>per guestbook</i>. They can 
  however post on more than one guestbook in a day. The script matches the poster's 
  IP address against posts made that day to that guestbook, instead of using cookies, 
  which can be circumvented. :)<br>
  <br>
  Now upload the rest of the filesd to your site. Don't upload this help file 
  or create_tables.php, those aren't needed. Once you've finished, you're ready 
  to start using GuestBookHost. :)</font></p>
