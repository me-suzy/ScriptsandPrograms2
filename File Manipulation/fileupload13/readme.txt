Description:

A simple, powerful tool to upload and 
manage files using your web browser.

#---------------------------------------#

What needed:

	-A webserver with PHP 4+
	-Very basic PHP Knowledge
	-A JavaScript capable web-browser

#---------------------------------------#

Instructions:

Open "index.php" in a text editor and edit 
the configurations if needed.
Upload all files in "fileupload" directory
to your webserver (PHP files in ASCII mode) 
preferably in it's own folder and for *Unix 
webservers, CHMOD the "store" directory to 0777. 
Now run it! (yoursite.com/fileupload/index.php)

There are 2 CSS (stylesheet) files located 
in the "img" directory. You can change 
between each one (style-def OR style-dot)
through the configuration part of index.php.

Enjoy and please send me feedback!
