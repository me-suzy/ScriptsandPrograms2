|  Security notes:
|  This file should be located outside the visible web (where most people will not be able to see your sensitive info).
|  People on the same server can see this file if the host has not disabled several commands from being used by php or perl, etc.
|  They will not be able to see this file if the server is using CGI PHP and it is properly configured and/or safemode is on and properly configured.
|  On a shared host that does not have safemode on, nor using CGI PHP (phpsuexec), nor disabled exec, backtick operator, etc, you may be out of luck. Get hosted elsewhere.
| 
|  Do NOT use the same password for your database as that used for your main account with your host. Always try to use a different password.
|  More than 10 lines are added at the begining of this script and at the end as a security measure. Some hosts forget to disable "top" and "tail" which will show the first and last 10 lines of any file.
