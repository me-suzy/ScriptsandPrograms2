1. purpose

  since i'm a lan party orga, i wrote this for our intranet system. participants can use it
  to announce their ftp service. note: this does not intend to support spreading of illegal
  content like warez, copyrighted mp3s, divx etc. but there are also other things which are
  legal, i.e. game patches, free music, demoscene products, linux etc.
  this code is just basic usage of php and mysql to store and recall data that was inserted
  via html forms. it is covered by the gpl - a copy should be included in this archive - so
  you can use it for free and modify it to your needs. read the gpl for more information on
  that.


2. installation

  first of all, you need a server system to run it on. i myself prefer LAMP (linux, apache,
  mysql, php). it requires php4 (http://www.php.net/) and mysql 3.x (http://www.mysql.org/)
  to work. i recommend you to use phpMyAdmin (http://phpwizard.net/projects/phpMyAdmin/) to
  manage your mysql database content with a webbrowser. please don't bother me with getting
  it all up and running, there are lots of good sources on the net to help you with that.
  if you got it running, you just have to extract the .php files to your favorite directory
  and import the .sql file into your database (using phpMyAdmin). of course, you might want
  to create some fake entries either via phpMyAdmin or the add form to test it out.
  if you want to check the server states periodically (and i'm sure you want to), you have
  to create an entry in your crontab which runs the refresh script i.e. every 30 minutes.


3. usage

  there should be 4 example files included in this archive which demonstrate the use of the
  different functions definded in the mod. file. feel free to change the design by adapting
  the example files' html/css tags (if given) to fit it to your existing website. you might
  also want to change the labels to your language which can be done in the mod. file, along
  with some color settings. you also have to change your links here if you rename the files
  (which you should do). the files and their function are:
     mod.ftpdb-example-add.php     - let people add their server with this form
     mod.ftpdb-example-list.php    - print a list of submitted servers and their state
     mod.ftpdb-example-refresh.php - refreshes the server states (run this from crontab)
     mod.ftpdb-example-status.php  - how to read server states to include in your site
  there is no form to change or delete entries yet, firstly for security reasons (or do you
  want your guests to delete entries by guessing the parameters?). but since you're already
  familiar with phpMyAdmin, you should be able to change or remove entries using this tool.
