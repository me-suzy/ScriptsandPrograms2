This file is used to replace every occurance of any string within any file on your server.  Simply copy the file into any directory and it will scan all files within that directory and its subdirectories replacing every occurance of the variable $oldserver with the value of $newserver.  It is essential when moving to a new server or domain if you have often used full paths to other files or images.  It can also be used to update links to another website if that site changes its domain.  On large sites this will take a long time to run so you may need to update your Apache config files or your php.ini, or run it in subdirectories first.
