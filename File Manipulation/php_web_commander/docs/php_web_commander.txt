1. Product Description
_______________________

PHP Web Commander is an application designed for web server usage.
The basic idea of the program concerns the possibility to manage files, ftp accounts, database, etc.
Similarly to the populars Windows files managers, the utility is endowed with an user-friendly interface, ensuring the same level of functional procedures.
Supporting a wide range of plugins, the application allows the user to configure his own Web Commander system, through miscellaneous commands.


Plugins:

   File Browsing
      - gives you an attractive look for managing file on the server
      - you can view, edit, copy, move, delete, CHMOD, rename multiple files or directories all at the same time
      - you can create new folders and download files
      - you have an option for multi CHMOD. Just select as many files / folders you want.
        You'll be asked for every file / folder the CHMOD value. If you want at a certain point to use the same value just enter %all% and all the other files will have the CHMOD value from the last value entered
      - you can do multi rename. Select the files / folders you want to rename. You'll be asked the new name for every file. you can enter it or use multi rename.
        Just type %multirename% and the last value will be taken for the rest of the files. For now you can use only a counter.
        Syntax is: some_text[CC...CC]some_text. Every 'C' will be replaced with a number starting from 0.
        For example: file_[C] will produce: file_0, file_1, file_2, etc
                     file_[CC] will produce: file_00, file_01, file_02, ..., file_09, file_10, file_11, etc
      - on copy and move you'll be asked if you want to overwrite the existing files even if they do not exist. If you click 'OK' all files will be overwritten. If you click 'Cancel' the existing files will be skipped. (this is used to speed it up, will be change in the future)
      - on view, you can view almost any text file, images and flashes.
      - on edit you can edit as many files you want. and make a back-up only for the ones you want
      - you can add as many icons for file types you want. Just name the icons like this: < file_extension >.gif and put it in < path_to_the_script >/templates/files/images/icons/
      - you have some shortcut keys to use for fast commands


   FTP Browsing

      - only one server (see configuration) for now
