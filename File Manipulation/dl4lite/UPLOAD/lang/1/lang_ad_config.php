The first option is perhaps the most important as it specifies how the script will attempt to override the default values. There are two methods of doing this. The first is php.ini. This is the safest option as the script will create a php.ini file in the script root. The second option, .htaccess, will create or ammend your .htaccess file in the script root. This option works more often but can also lead to Error 500's. If this happens you can edit the .htaccess file in the script root directory and remove any line starting 'php_value'. Some servers will not allow any overrides at all in this case all you can do is ask the web hosts to raise the upload limit.",

The script will continue to send these chunks until the file has been completely read and sent to the browser.
