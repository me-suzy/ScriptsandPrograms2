Program Summary:

Php Random Page is a php program code that allows users to 
randomly present a viewer with predetermined pages;
created to randomly present viewer with a survey, human click
thingie, advertisement and the like. The program is preset for
five random pages, but may be changed. Meddle if you dare.

A simple interface module allows the owner of the program to change
the URL destinations desired.

code itself, readme,txt and copyright.txt  file included in code distribution.

Anyone using this program must leave the credits intact in all pages 
associated with the program.  (This includes pages generated by the

Let's help others to find these scripts too, okay?

Failure to include credit information as outlined above will result
in the license being revoked. What does that mean? Well, it'll mean
you're a nasty so-and-so and will be using it illegally. When I win
some gazillion dollar prize, I might even prosecute. :)

Getting Started with PHP Random Page:

This assumes that you have permission to execute php programs on your
server, and that you know where the programs have to go.
If you don't know whether or not you
have permission to do this, or if you don't know where the programs
must go, ask the technical support people for your website.

Here's how I recommend you set up PHP Random Page:

1. Make a folder (directory) called "phprandompage" on your web server.
   If you can make folders outside your HTML document tree (ask your local
   tech support if you can do this), then make it there. (Please see
   "Setting up Files, Directories, and Permissions" below.)  Otherwise, 
    you may place the code anywhere you desire. You may choose to
    use PHP Random Page as a start page, in which case you may desire
    to rename phprandompage.php to index.php so the rascal while fire
    up when a viewer points to the particular directory, whether it be root or
    a sub-directory. 
   
   

2. Upload the following files to the folder:

   phprandompage.pgp

   Make sure that you upload them in ASCII (text) and not Binary mode.
   Any questions see the forums, http://sourceforge.net/projects/phprandompage/

3. 
    Now you're ready to try out the program!  To make sure everything is
    working, pull up the phprandompage.php program in your browser. For
    example:

    http://www.your.site/phprandompage.php

     It should take you to your set destinations.  



     That's pretty much all there is to it.  Enjoy!

Setting up Files, Directories, and Permissions


Please note that when I say "/home/users/yourname/phprandompage" I am speaking of
your "home directory" as it is known to the tech folks.  If you ask
your tech support people "What is the full system path to my home
directory?" then they should be able to tell you.  Sometimes this might
be something like "/var/opt/web/data/yourlogin" or something totally
different.  You've got to get this information from the people who
run the server where your website is.

Now, on some web servers, all of your files are in your web root, and
there's no way to get out of it.  If this is the case, there may be hope.
Sometimes, your  directory (if you have one) will refuse to show
the contents of files to people unless there is actually code stored. If
this is the case, find your desired directory, and make a folder in
there called "phprandompage", and chmod it 777 (world read/write/execute).

All in all, it really doesn't matter where you put your directory for
the phprandompage file.  However, it must be readable by the web server,
so this is often the way you have to do it.  Note that *nothing* on the
web is truly secure, so please take this with a grain of salt.  Someone
who is determined to get at your code probably can -- this will
just make it a tiny bit harder, or, if not harder, at least a bit more
time consuming.

Notes About File Permissions:

     Normally permissions will not have to be changed.

     You should always, always be 
     cooperative with your systems administrator. They work very hard and get 
     very little thanks, but most of them are very willing to help if they can.

What to Do About Problems:

A few notes:  If bringing up the phprandompage.php URL (address) gives you
an error (especially "Internal Server Error"), here are a few things to
check:

 1. Did you ftp the files in ascii mode?  If not this could be a headache 
     down the pike.

 2. Is PHP installed on your server?

 3. Do you have destination locations entered correctly. Many times a
     simple typo, or mispelling can mess things up.

IMPORTANT:  If you contact me with a problem about this program, you
            MUST give me as much information as possible.  Please
            include:

            The name of this program.  (I have several programs on this
            website, and many of them do things with php,  so if you
            email me saying "The program doesn't work" or "Your php
            script doesn't work" I won't know what you're talking about.)

            The version of this program. (This is Php Random Page Version).

            The information that the server shows when you use
            the program.

            The error message you got.

            The location (web address) of where you set up the program
            (http:// etc) so I can look at it.

             If you encounter other problems with this system, please let me know
             by dropping a line to Scott Mann (mandingo2003@users.sourceforge.net).
