Let's help others to find these scripts too, okay?

Failure to include credit information as outlined above will result
in the license being revoked. What does that mean? Well, it'll mean
you're a nasty so-and-so and will be using it illegally. When I win
some gazillion dollar prize, I might even prosecute. :)

How to install this rascal, fast quick and in a hurry: 
1. In the line $randomnumber = rand(0,4); change rand(0,4); to   
say the first and last numbers of the random topic array. 
2. Add and change the sample destinations below. 
3. Use a PHP include to insert this script into a parsed shtml of   
your website, if you do not want to name it index.php

srand((double)microtime()*1000000); 
$randomtopic = rand(0,5);
