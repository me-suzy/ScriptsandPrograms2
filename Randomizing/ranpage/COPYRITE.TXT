Anyone using this program must leave the credits intact in all pages

Let's help others to find these scripts too, okay?

Failure to include credit information as outlined above will result
in the license being revoked. What does that mean? Well, it'll mean
you're a nasty so-and-so and will be using it illegally. When I win
some gazillion dollar prize, I might even prosecute. :)
