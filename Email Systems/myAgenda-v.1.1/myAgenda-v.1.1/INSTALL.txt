SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* MySQL
* PHP 4.0 or later, compiled with MySQL support
* Linux Cron access or similar schedule program

INSTALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* Open files/config.php with your favorite text editor and edit variables

* Create or choose a database to use with the myAgenda tables.
  For creating a new db, firstly login to MySql server:
 /path/to/your/mysql -ppassword

on your MySql shell type:
mysql> create database myagenda;

* Then you need to configure the mysql server to grant access priveleges on myagenda database
  to whatever username you configured in config.php $sql_user variable and also whatever password 
  you set with $sql_pass. To do this, login to mysql server and type the commands below.

mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER
       ON agenda.*
       TO agenda@localhost
       IDENTIFIED BY 'agenda';
       exit;

 If you do not have root or create access to MySql server then use the db 
 you already have. Do not forget to set them in config.php

* Run 
/path/to/your/mysql -ppassword yourdb < /path/to/myAgenda/myAgenda.sql
  This will create all the tables myAgenda needs. Remove myAgenda.sql after
  you have finished your work with that file. (This is just let another people
  not to view your sql structure via web).

  P.S: I have tested the above command on a Win98/MySql. All the uppercase 
  letters turned to lowercase. This will crash the program. Be aware. All the
  letters shoud be as same as in myAgenda.sql

* To send reminders, add a cron entry like below. This will check every day at 8.15 am
  if there is a reminder; then sr.php will do the work. One more point is the user/pass
  we set in config.php with $auth_us/$auth_ps. Write these variables values to your cron
  entry also. text.txt is a null value. Never mind it.
  
  15 8 * * * /usr/bin/lynx -auth=agenda:agenda -dump http://www.yourdomain.com/agenda/sr.php >  text.txt

* Upload all the scripts to your web directory. 
	   
* Go http://yourdomain.com/path/to/myAgenda/ and see your agenda.
