*************************************

Requirements:
The script requires a webserver that supports PHP, the PHP GD libraries, and ability to add a custom .htaccess file that will be read by the script if you want to use it as a PNG image script file.

*************************************

Installation Instructions:
1.) Extract all the files from the zip file into a folder of your choosing.
2.) Open Countdown.php and edit the variables at the top of the page. Descriptions have been provided.

*************************************

Usage Instructions:
Use the following url and replace the pathing with your site.

http://www.yourdomain.com/script_folder/countdown.php

** NOTE! - Some forums block the use of PHP as an imaging tool. To get around this, I have provided the htaccess.txt file that contains the lines you need to fix that.  Just rename 'htaccess.txt' to '.htaccess'

Then, rename the countdown.php file to countdown.png and point your [img] tags to that image. The .htaccess file will process the png file as a php script and execute.

*************************************

I wrote this script for my Halflife 2 site, www.hl2empire.com, for a countdown. You can change the variables and the background image to suit what your going after, but that is provided as an example.

If you have any questions or problems, feel free to let me know!

Good luck and enjoy!
