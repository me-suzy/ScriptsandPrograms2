ABOUT
The Pregnancy Script is meant to allow pregnant women to provide automatic weekly pregnancy updates right on their websites.  The script announces a pregnancy, tells the name and gender (if specified) of the baby, counts the weeks of the pregnancy and the days until the due date, and provides weekly information on fetal development.

DISCLAIMER
This script is JUST FOR FUN!  It's a toy.  If you read something here, and your doctor or midwife tells you something different, believe them!  They are trained professionals, and I am just a geeky homeschool mom with some time on my hands.

CREDITS
Some of the information used to write this script was gleaned from:

REQUIREMENTS
You must be able to use php on your website to use this script.

HOW TO USE
Edit the variables in pregnancy.php.  Upload pregnancy.php and path.php to the same directory.  Use your browser to view path.php and follow the directions there.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Almost everything this script does is based on the date of your last period.  It is based on a 28 day cycle.  Your cycle may be longer or shorter, so if the results seem wrong to you, fiddle with that date until you are satisfied.  If you have any questions, please post them at http://usr-bin-mom.com/journal.php?id=402
