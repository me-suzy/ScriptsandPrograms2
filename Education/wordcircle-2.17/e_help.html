            </strong>The first part of this help guide is for people interested
            in understanding how to use wordcircle. Alternatively, if you are
            an administrator looking for information about installing or setting
            up wordcircle skip to <a href="#install">section
            2</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="reg"></a>1.01 Registration<br>
            </strong>The first step in using wordcircle is registration. From
            the wordcircle home page, click  the &quot;Register&quot; menu item
            on the left-hand side. The next screen will show you the registration.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="log" id="log"></a>1.02 Logging In and Out<br>
            </strong>Once you have registered, use your email and password to
            login by clicking on the &quot;Login&quot; menu item and completing
            the login form. Click the &quot;remember me on this computer&quot; if
            you do not want to login everytime you visit the website. If this
            is a public computer, do not select this option as anyone who uses
            the computer will be able to login and use your account. </p>
          <p>As soon as you login, you
              are automatically directed to the &quot;My Courses&quot; page where you can
            add courses to your course list. If you have already added courses,
          you will see them appear towards the top of the page. </p>
          <p>To logout,
              click the logout menu item on the left hand side. <strong><br>
            </strong></p>
          <p><strong><a name="user" id="user"></a>1.03 User Info <br>
</strong>Once logged in, you should see a &quot;User Info&quot; menu item on the left-hand
side. Click on this to see a list of all of the users in your courses. The first
user in the list will be you. Click on the Edit link to the right of your information
to edit your profile. Remember that your email address is also your login name.
If you change your email address, do not forget to enter the new address next
time you login.</p>
          <p>If you own are the System Admin and you click &quot;User Info&quot; you will
            see all of the users for all of the courses, not just the course
            you are currently viewing. </p>
          <p><strong><a name="course"></a>1.04 Adding / Removing Courses <br>
            </strong>As soon as you login, you will be directed to the &quot;My Courses&quot;
            page. At any point, you can return to this page by clicking the &quot;My
            Courses &quot;
            menu item on the left-hand side.</p>
          <p>You cannot view or edit the contents of a course until you add it
            to your list. There are two options for adding courses to your list.
            <strong>(A) </strong>You can add someone else's course to your list
            or <strong>(B)</strong> you can create a new course of your own -
            it will be automatically added to your list afterwards. </p>
          <p><strong>(A)</strong> To add someone else's course to your list 
            must have a course <strong>key</strong>.  If the course
            is a public course, you can get this key by clicking on the Course
            List link. If the course is private you must get the <strong>key </strong>from
            your teacher or the person that created the course. Without a
            key, you will not be able to access any courses. Once you get the
            course key, enter it in the form at the bottom of the page and click
            the &quot;Add Someone Else's Course          &quot; button.
          Your course will now added to your course list. </p>
          <p><strong>(B) </strong>To create your own  course,
              think of a unique name such as &quot;Alaska University - Biology
              1022 - Mr. Smith&quot; - 
                enter the name in the form at the bottom of the page. <em>You
                can't change this name so be careful what you choose. </em>Next,
                choose whether the course will be public or private. Public courses
                are listed in the Course List and private courses are hidden
                from the list. After entering your course name and choosing public/private
                status, click on the &quot;Create
                My Own Course&quot; button.
                Your course will now added to your course list. For private courses
                - make sure to write down the course key and give it
                to your students - they will not be able to access the course
                without it. To view or put materials in this course, click on
                the course name from the list. </p>
          <p>To remove a course, click on
                the &quot;remove&quot; link
                next to the course information. Removing a course that you created
                is equivalent to deleting it - and this is a permanent decision.
                Once a course is removed, all of the thoughts, calendar items,
                discussions and documents are also deleted. Removing a course
                that you did not create just takes it off your list. You can
                always add it back again by entering the course key [see <strong>(A)</strong>]. </p>          
          <p><a name="over"></a><strong><img src="icon_home.gif" width="15" height="15">1.05 Course Overview<br>
            </strong>After you choose a course from your course list, you will
            see a list of   News, Calendar items, Discussions and Documents
            that belong to it. If each one of these things is empty it means
            the person who created the course has not created any materials for
            the course yet. If you created the course, 
            you must use the <strong>modify</strong> links to create these
            items. </p>
          <p>The Course Overview also contains an &quot;Overview&quot; box where the course
            owner can write a small description of what the course contains,
            who it is for and any other information that can help students to
            understand the context of the work they will be doing. </p>
<p><a name="thoughts" id="thoughts"></a><strong><img src="icon_news.gif" width="10" height="11">1.06 News <br>
          </strong>News items  are created by the person who created the course
          only.
          News can be things like &quot;The campus store is running
          out of notebooks, be sure to get one!&quot; or &quot;Congrats to Jenny
          Herman on her gold medal.&quot;  People like to see new content
          on websites so try to update these thoughts as often as you can
          and remove  outdated ones. If you created this course , you can create
          or modify News by clicking on the <strong>modify</strong> links that
          appear above the News box.</p>
          <p><a name="cal" id="cal"></a><strong><img src="icon_cal.gif" width="15" height="16">1.07 Calendar <br>
          </strong>Calendar items are created by the the person who created the
          course only. This could be used instead of or in addition to a printed
          syllabus. If you created this course, you can create or modify Calendar
          items by using  the <strong>modify</strong> links that appear above
          the calendar box.</p>
          <p><a name="cal" id="cal"></a><strong><img src="icon_group.gif" width="14" height="17">1.08 Discussions <br>
          </strong>Discussions are created by the person who created the course
          but the topics and messages in each discussion can be created
          by anyone. If you created the course, you can 
          create or modify a Discussion by using the <strong>modify</strong> link
          that appears above the discussion box.
          Once a Discussion is created, anyone can click on the name of the discussion
          to see a list of topics. Topics are sorted in order of recent activity.
          To create a new topic, open the Discussion page, click on a discussion
          and use the form at the bottom of the page. To read messages within
          a certain topic, click on its name. Also, you can have emails sent
          to you whenever someone posts a message to this topic by clicking the &quot;Subscribe&quot; link.
          To cancel these messages, click the
          &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; link.</p>
          <p>If you created the course, you are the only one who can remove a
            discussion. By removing a Discussion, all of the topics and messages
            are also removed (permanently deleted). Students are able to edit
            and remove (delete) the topics and messages that  they created only. </p>
          <p>Discussions can be categorized so that certain discussions appear
            above others in a logical order. For example, a group of discussions
            could be placed into the category &quot;First Semester.&quot; Then, this category
            could be shifted to the top of the discussion list during the first
            semester and moved downwards during second semester. To work with
            categories, the course owner should click the <strong>modify </strong>link
            and click the &quot;modify discussion categories&quot; link. Note that your
            discussions do not have to have categories but the layout will not
            be consistent if you assign <em>some</em> discussions and not all
            of them to a category. </p>
          <p><a name="cal" id="cal"></a><strong><img src="icon_materials.gif" width="14" height="16">1.09 Course Materials <br>
          </strong>Documents are uploaded / saved by those who created the course
           but are available to anyone for download. These documents are
          usually assignments or course materials assigned by a teacher. The
          size limitation on documents is set by the system administrator - it
          is usually 16MB although it can vary depending on how the database
          and PHP are setup on the server. If you created the course you can
           upload or remove a Document by using the <strong>modify </strong>link
           above the documents box. It is also possible to upload links instead
           of documents. Read the instructions in the modify page for an explanation. </p>
          <p><a name="proj" id="proj"></a><strong><img src="icon_proj.gif" width="14" height="14">1.10 Projects <br>
          </strong>Projects are places where students can upload their own files,
          write journal entries and share either / both with other students as
          well as their teacher. </p>
          <p>Projects are either mandatory or voluntary. The only difference
            between these two types of projects is that a mandatory project will
            show up in <em>everyone's</em> project list automatically while voluntary
            projects must be manually added in order for it to show up in a person's
            project list.</p>
          <p>Anyone can create a voluntary project, but only the course owner
              (teacher) can create a mandatory project. </p>
          <p>From either the Course Overview or Projects page, you can
            see all of the projects that are in your list. If no projects
            appear it is because the course owner has not created any mandatory
            projects. Either way, there may be voluntary projects available.
            These can be viewed and added to your list by clicking on the <img src="icon_look.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="2" align="top">voluntary
            projects list link. If there are no projects in the voluntary projects
            list you can <img src="icon_new.gif" width="18" height="18" hspace="2">create a new project.</p>
          <p>Select a project from your projects list to see the details of that
            project. To see your own work, upload new files or make journal entries,
            select your name from the list of participants below. If you would
            like to see someone else's course work, select their name from the
            participants list.</p>
          <p>After selecting your name from the participants list you will be
            able to upload files and journal entries. Note that this information
            is kept private from other students in your course unless you choose
            to make it public. The course owner (teacher) <em>can</em> see your
            private files and journal entries, and add his/her journal entries
            along with them.</p>
          <p><a name="install"></a><strong>2.01 Installation and Setup (Admins
            Only)<br>
            </strong>To install the wordcircle files - follow these directions: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Unzip the files into a directory
              where you know PHP is available - name it whatever you want - we'll
              assume you name it 'wordcircle' for now </li>
            <li> From a UNIX command prompt type the following command: 


              <br>
            prompt&gt; chmod -R 777 wordcircle (change this to your directory
            name)<br>
            <strong>Note</strong>: There are other ways to change permissions - most FTP programs
            offer this functionality as well</li>
            <li>In a browser, open (run) the file <strong>install.php</strong></li>
            <li>Follow the instructions </li>
            <li>To install wordcircle manually, please refer to the install scripts
              at the <a href="#script">bottom of this page</a></li>
          </ol>          
          <p><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you are <strong>upgrading </strong>
            wordcircle - you should not run the install script as it will overwrite
              your database. So far, it is not necessary to make database modifications
              for a new install. All you need to do is copy all of the latest
              files into your directory <strong>except for the settings.php file. </strong> Keep
              this file intact and your database / admin settings will remain
              the same.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="custom"></a>2.02 Customizing the Look and Feel<br>
            </strong>While wordcircle will always follow the same basic framework,
            you can change all of the colors, headers, footers and images very
            easily by using the following references:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Style Sheets </strong>are saved in a file &quot;e_style.html&quot;
              - editing it will change the look and feel of the entire website.
              Make sure to backup the original. It is heavily commented to give
              you some clues about what to modify. Note that no font tags or
              inline styles are used - the <em>entire</em> site is controlled
              with style sheets. </p>
            <p>The <strong>header</strong> file is saved as &quot;e_header.html&quot; - this
              is where the image exists that you see at the top of every page.
            </p>
            <p>The <strong>footer</strong> file is saved as &quot;e_footer.html&quot; - note the use of Javascript
              for the email to prevent spamming.</p>
            <p>The <strong>welcome message </strong>is contained in the file
              e_welcome.html. This is the text that appears when people load wordcircle
              before logging in. </p>
            <p>The image of the circles that &quot;blink&quot; across the screen everytime
              you update database is a .gif named <strong>icon_circle.gif</strong> -
              the width is 200 and the height is 40. If you would like to create
              another blinking color widget - make sure to name it icon_circle.gif
              and give it the same dimensions. </p>

          are on the horizon:</p>
          <ol><li>Assessments (2004)</li>
            <li>Rubrics (2005)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you have questions or comments, visit the wordcircle project
            page at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wordcircle/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wordcircle/</a> and
      post a message or bug.          
          <p><a name="script" id="script"></a> <strong>Install Scripts<br>
          </strong>If you could not run the install script, there is an alternative
          way of getting wordcircle up and running. First open the file settings.php
          and modify this file as follows:
          <p>$GLOBALS['configured'] = true;//WARNING IF THIS IS FALSE SOMEONE
          CAN RUN THE INSTALL
          <p>$GLOBALS['dbServer'] = 'your server name';</p>

          <p>$GLOBALS['dbUser'] = 'your db user name';</p>
          <p>$GLOBALS['dbPass'] = 'your db users password';</p>
          <p>$GLOBALS['admin_email'] = 'your@email.address';</p>
          <p>Next, copy the following SQL statements and paste them into your
            mySQL admin console. <strong>Make sure to edit the final SQL statement
            to reflect your information.</strong></p>
