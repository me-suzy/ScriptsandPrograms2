<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
  We'd first like to thank you for your interest in My DataBook and look forward 
  to being able to assist you with managing your time. My DataBook will assist 
  you with everyday time consuming appointments, tasks and scheduling. We hope 
  you'll enjoy the feature rich application and help us improve on it's functionality 
  and reliability by providing valuable feed back on it's performance and ease 
  of use. Once You have the application installed you can access help for any 
  assistance you might need by clicking on the &quot;support/ help&quot; link 
  thats located at the top of the main login screen.</p>
<p><strong>2. Requirements</strong><br>
  Before we can start the installation of My DataBook you'll need to meet some 
  minimum requirements. You must have PHP 4.3 or high istalled on your server. 
  You must also have access to MySQL 4.0 or higher installed on your server or 
  a server that you are able to connect with. MySQL is required due to the database 
  holding all the information that you'll have in your DataBook. While PHP is 
  required to bring all the data to you via the internet.</p>
<p><strong>3. Installation</strong><br>
  First thing you want to do is create a directory named &quot;mdb&quot; to install 
  My DataBook into. If you need assistance with creating a directory please consult 
  your hosting service for assistance. But you should be able to do this with 
  any FTP program. After the creation of the directory (&quot;mdb&quot;) you'll 
  want to password it so that nobody will have access to your DataBook without 
  the username and password. My DataBook doe's not have built in user authentication 
  so it is important that you make your new directory password protected. For 
  assistance on this you will again want to consult your hosting service. If you 
  are familure with scripting and want to try and create your own .htaccess file 
  you can find a tutorial on it <a href="http://javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess3.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> 
  There are also a number of sites and tutorials to assist you with the creation 
  of a .htaccess file. For more tutorials on this click <a href="http://www.theadminshop.com/search/index.php?REQ=htaccess" target="_blank">here</a>. 
  After you have protected your &quot;mdb&quot; directory you'll need to create 
  another directory inside the &quot;mdb&quot; directory called &quot;images&quot;. 
  It <font color="#FF0000">must</font> be named exactly the same way or none of 
  your images will appear in My DataBook.</p>
<p>Once you have the directory &quot;mdb&quot; created and protected you can start 
  transfering the files that came in the zip file. You must upload all the files 
  in the zip, leaving one out will result in failure when trying to run My DataBook. 
  After unzipping the file you'll find 28 files and a images directory containing 
  a number of images. Upload all the files to your &quot;mdb&quot; directory and 
  all the images to the &quot;images&quot; directory. </p>
<p>Ok now before we can run the install script you'll need to set the permissions 
  on the &quot;mdb&quot; directory to 666 in order for the install script to be 
  able to create the needed files.</p>
<p>With all that completed all you have to do now is run the setup.php file and 
  let My DataBook complete it's own installation. (e.g. http://www.yoursite_url.com/mdb/setup.php) 
  The script will ask you some questions and all you have to do is answer the 
  questions and you'll be up and running in now time.</p>
<p>After the setup is completed you'll want to <font color="#FF0000">delete</font> 
  the setup.php file.</p>
<p><strong>4. Manual Installation</strong><br>
  If for some reason the setup script did not work for you please let us know 
  by clicking <a href="http://board.theadminshop.com/viewforum.php?f=5" target="_blank">here</a> 
  so that we can make the needed changes in the next release. Your feed back is 
  important the improvements of My DataBook. </p>
<p>In order to install My DataBook manually your going to follow the above instructions 
  aside from running the setup.php file. Instead of running that your going to 
  need to create the database tables manually by running the sql statements included 
  in the tables.sql file. If you are running phpMyAdmin on your site then all 
  you have to do is upload the file to phpMyAdmin and it will create all the needed 
  tables for you. If you don't have phpMyAdmin then i would suggest getting it 
  <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p> Now with the tables created you'll have to create a file named &quot;data.inc.php&quot; 
  and enter the following information into it,</p>
<p>$DB_host=&quot;localhost&quot;; // this being the MySQL server location. Normally 
  localhost works fine<br>
  $DB_name=&quot;Database Name&quot;; // the name of the database that holds all 
  your tables<br>
  $DB_pass=&quot;Password&quot;; // the password to connect to the MySQL database<br>
  $DB_user=&quot;User Name&quot;; // the user name that you would use to connect 
  to the MySQL database</p>
<p>$YOU=&quot;Your Name&quot;; // Yep Your name<br>
  $YOUR_EMAIL=&quot;Your@Email.You&quot;; // Your email address</p>
<p>// These names should match the tables that where created in your MySQL database<br>
  // Change them if needed but they <font color="#FF0000">MUST MATCH</font> incorrect 
  names will result in failure<br>
  // when trying to run My DataBook<br>
  $Table_notes=&quot;MDB_notes&quot;;<br>
  $Table_contacts=&quot;MDB_contacts&quot;;<br>
  $Table_groups=&quot;MDB_groups&quot;;<br>
  $Table_reminders=&quot;MDB_reminders&quot;;<br>
  $Table_diary=&quot;MDB_diary&quot;;<br>
  $Table_tasks=&quot;MDB_tasks&quot;;<br>
  $Table_task_updates=&quot;MDB_tasks_update&quot;;<br>
  $Table_appointments=&quot;MDB_appointments&quot;;<br>
  $Table_scheduled_notes=&quot;MDB_scheduled_notes&quot;;</p>
<p>Assuming you followed all the above directions you should be able to run My 
  DataBook without any problems. If you still experience problems let us know 
  by clicking <a href="http://board.theadminshop.com/viewforum.php?f=5" target="_blank">here</a> 
  and we will do everything we can to make sure it works.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cron Settings</strong><br>
  In order for the email reminders to work you must start a cron job and have 
  it exicute the cronjob.php file every night at midnight (or whenever you want 
  the emails to be sent to you). If you need assistance with creating a cronjob 
  you can click <a href="http://www.theadminshop.com/search/index.php?REQ=cron%20setup" target="_blank">here</a> 
  and locate a tutorial. For those who have access to the cron settings via control 
  panel your want to run the following comand,</p>
<p>lynx -dump http://www.your.com/path/to/mdb/cronjob.php</p>
<p>Make the intervals every 24 hours at midnight and your done. If you don't have 
  access to creating cronjobs then you'll have to consult your hosting company 
  and have them set it up for you.<br>
</p>
<p>Again we would like to that you for your interest in My DataBook.<br>
