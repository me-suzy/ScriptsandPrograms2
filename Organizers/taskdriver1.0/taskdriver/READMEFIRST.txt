TaskDriver Setup:

The install creates 2 users for you.

Admin user was created for the inital setup and maintenance. You will need to login with this account to setup TaskDriver.

Login: admin 
Password: admin

* You should change the profile and password information of this account for security reasons.

You will also need to create categories with this login before you submit any tasks. You will also need to appoint Managers. You can assign manager access by viewing a members profile under the "View Members" menu option. 


The second user that was installed is testuser. testuser has Assignee access. You will need assignees available to assign work to.

A: There are 2 levels of access not including the Admin level. Level 2 is assignee level access. Level 3 is the manager level access.

Q: What exactly is an Manager?

Q: What do the statuses mean? (Received, Assigned, In Progress, On Hold, Complete, Cancelled)
1. Received is an automatic setting that shows that the system has received the new task.
2. Assigned reveals that the ticket is assigned and that work is about to begin.
3. In Progress states that the work on the task has begun.
4. On Hold means that the task was placed on HOLD for whatever reason. (Managers or Assignees can place tasks on Hold)
5. Complete means that the task has been successfully completed.
6. Cancelled status means that the task has been cancelled. No further work is required.
