Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent INSERT operations reuse old record positions. Running the Optimize Tables routine reclaims the unused space. It is recommended you run this procedure regularily to ensure the best possible performance.<br><br>While the Optimize Tables routine is executing, the original table is readable by other clients. Updates and writes to the table are stalled until the new table is ready. This is done in such a way that all updates are automatically redirected to the new table without any failed updates.<br><br>The Message Type returned should be one of status (normal), error, info, or warning. If a Message Type other than "status" and a Message of "OK" is returned, you may have to run a repair on the table. Read the Message carefully to determine if this is required.');
