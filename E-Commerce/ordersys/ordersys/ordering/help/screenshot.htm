<p>OrderSys ordering system is a customizable, optionally user account-based, web-based PHP and MySQL - based software system for purchase ordering and tracking items; it was designed for use in a biomedical research laboratory but can be used in other settings.</p>
<p>Some screenshots are provided here for visitors to get an idea of how the application (version 1.5, October 23, 2005) looks like and of some of its features.</p>
<img src="../images/item_list.jpeg" alt="image" border="1" /><p>A shot of an items listing page is shown above - note the search and sort options.</p>
<img src="../images/item_list2.jpeg" alt="image" border="1" /><p>A shot of the lower portion of the same items listing page is shown above - note the search and export options.</p>
<img src="../images/add_item.jpeg" alt="image" border="1" /><p>Above is a shot of the 'add an item' form. Note that the form fields, their types, etc., can all be customized through an in-built Interface Creator. Below are two screenshots showing the Interface Creator pages. Note that the second image is of a form-field configurator page.</p>
