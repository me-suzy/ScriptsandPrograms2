Introduction 
Typically, when using this type of advanced integration you would open up a 
socket connection using fsockopen on port 443, then post your fields, and 
finally read the response. For whatever reason, I can not seem to get this 
to work with Authorize.net. The alternative now is to use CURL (Client URL 
Library Functions). This is direct from php.net: 

"PHP supports libcurl, a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that allows you to 
connect and communicate to many different types of servers with many different 
types of protocols. libcurl currently supports the http, https, ftp, gopher, 
telnet, dict, file, and ldap protocols. libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, 
HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading (this can also be done with PHP`s ftp 
extension), HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, and user+password 
authentication." 

Authorize.net does provide sample scripts for the SIM (Simple Integration method) 
for PHP, but doesn`t seem to provide any documentation for the AIM. I hope that 
this short sample can help! The AIM allows you, in your script, to process the 
transaction and get a response back without the user ever leaving your website. 
With the SIM the user posts the information to authorize.net, and then redirects 
back to your website.
