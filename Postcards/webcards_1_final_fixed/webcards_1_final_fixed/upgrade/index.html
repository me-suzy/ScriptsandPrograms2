<span class="main_header">WebCards Upgrade Guide - Upgrade to version 1.0 final</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="sub_header">Introduction</span>
<br /><br />
<b>Please note:</b> If you are upgrading from beta 4 to version 1 final you do not need to run an upgrade script.<br />
Simply upload all of the files inside the /upload/ folder <i>excluding</i> the config.php file.
<br /><br />

The upgrade files are located inside this (./upgrade) directory <b>but you must ensure you use the correct one</b>. They are not uploaded by default to your server as a security precaution.
<br />
Using the wrong upgrade script is likely to damage your database, rendering your WebCards installation unusable so always ensure you use the correct one.
<br /><br />
This release sees the "gold" release of WebCards version 1. It includes 3 upgrade scripts to upgrade sequentially from previous versions. Read the note at the top of the page if you are upgrading from beta 4.
<br /><br />
If you wish to upgrade you must do so sequentially. If you currently have beta 1 installed and would like to upgrade to this version you must upgrade to beta 2, then upgrade that to beta 3 and finally upgrade to beta 4. This ensures that all changes are made to your installation.
<br /><br />
<span class="sub_header">Upgrade process</span>
<br /><br />
Upgrading is a very simple process.
<ul>
<li>First of all you should backup your database in case anything goes wrong. You can do this with a program such as PHPMyAdmin. Most hosts supply such software but it can be downloaded free from <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net" target="_blank">the website</a>.</li>
<li>All of the files used in WebCards have been heavily modified. You will not be able to reuse any of your old templates or language files.</li>
<li><span style="color:red;">IMPORTANT:</span> you should not overwrite your config.php file or else you will lose all of your settings.</li>
<li>Now you should run the upgrade script <b>upgrade_beta3_to_beta4.php</b> to upgrade from beta 3 to beta 4.</li>
<li>You should then upload all of the files that came with the new version <b>except config.php</b>. This file contains important information that should not be overwritten during the upgrade process.</li>
<li>Finally, you should log into the administration centre and check the configuration section to ensure all the information is still correct. You should also send a test WebCard to ensure the process went smoothly.</li>
<li><span style="color:red;">VERY IMPORTANT:</span> you should remove the upgrade_beta3_to_beta4.php file from your server as it can damage your system if somebody accesses it after you have upgraded.</li>
</ul>

If you are having trouble upgrading you can visit the <a href="http://webcards.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WebCards Website</a> for support.
