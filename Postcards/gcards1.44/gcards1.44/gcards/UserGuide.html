<h2>About gCards</h2>

<a name="Overview" id="Overview"><h3>gCards Overview</h3></a>
gCards is a free PHP-based eCard system that is easy to setup and use. 
gCards simple Administration Console allows the administrator to upload images,
add eCard categories, and modify existing settings - 
no more messing with HTML or PHP to get your eCard site up and running!  
<br><br>
gCards is my first stab at a PHP application (or any other programming endeavour) so go easy on me.

<a name="Credits" id="Credits"><h3>Credits</h3></a>
gCards is created, designed, and maintained by me - Greg Neustaetter.  It was originally developed
as a self-imposed project to learn PHP.  It seemed like a good project - combining database interaction,
dynamic user interfaces, image manipulation, and email.  When I finished I posted it on <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com">HotScripts.com</a>
and was VERY surprised when about 500 people downloaded it in the first week.
<br><br>
In the great tradition of the open source community I like to reuse existing technology whenever possible.  The following
scripts or other technologies are used in gCards:
<ul>
	<li><b>ADOdb Database Library</b> (<a href="http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB" target="_blank">http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB</a>) -
	ADOdb is a database abstraction library created for PHP.  It supports a wide-range of commercial and open-source databases.
	This is used for all database interactions within gCards.</li>
	<li><b>htmlArea</b> (<a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/" target="_blank">http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/</a>) -
	htmlArea is a WYSIWYG editor that can be used to replace any textarea field for Windows users on IE 5.5+.  Other users see a standard
	textarea.  gCards uses htmlArea for composing eCards and for news item creation in the gCards Administration Console.</li>
	<li><b>PHPMailer</b> (<a href="http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/</a>) -
	PHPMailer is an object-oriented PHP class that simplifies the process of sending email with PHP.  PHPMailer lets gCards users use the standard PHP
	mail functions or SMTP instead.  PHPMailer was added to gCards in release 1.21 of gCards</li>
	<li><b>Image Resizer</b> (<a href="http://horobey.com/demos/imgresize/v5/article/index.html" target="_blank">http://horobey.com/demos/imgresize/v5/article/index.html</a>) -
	Image Resizer is an object-oriented PHP class that simplifies the process of resizing images with the GD or GD2 Graphics Library.
	gCards uses image resizer to (optionally) automatically generate thumbnails for JPEG images</li>	
</ul> 


<h2>Installing gCards</h2>

<a name="Requirements" id="Requirements"><h3>Requirements</h3></a>
<ul>
	<li><b>PHP</b> - Not quite sure what version is required - version 4.1 used to be required but now
	it uses the $HTTP_*_VARS instead of the autoglobals, so support should go back a bit further now!</li>
	<li><b>MySQL</b> - gCards was written to use the free MySQL relational database.  It was written with the
	ADODB database library and could probably be modified to use other databases fairly easily</li>
	<li><b>GD or GD2 Image Library</b> - The GD or GD2 image libraries are used to automatically create thumbnails
	in the gCards administration console.  These are commonly bundled with PHP - GD2 is bundled with PHP 4.3 by default.  GD2 will provide much higher
	quality thumbnails.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Installation" id="Installation"><h3>gCards Installation</h3></a>
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest gCards version from the <a href="http://www.gregphoto.net/gcards">official site</a></li>
	<li>Create a database to hold the gCards database tables (or use an existing database)</li>
	<li>Open the config.php and change the values to reflect your database connection properties and your gCards options</li>
	<li>If PHP's mail functions don't work on your server, change the mail settings for gCards in config_email.php</li>
	<li>Upload the files to your web server</li>
	<li>Browse to the setup.php file and choose to do a new install - this will create the database tables and create an admin user.
		If there are errors creating the tables then your database information is probably incorrect - fix it in the config.php and try again</li>
	<li>CHMOD the 'images' and 'sound' directories to '777' to allow image/sound uploads and modification</li>
	<li><strong>Delete setup.php or CHMOD it to '000' so that it cannot be accessed</strong></li>
	<li>Login to the gCards Administration Console with the user: 'admin' password: 'admin'.  You can access the login page at login.php</li>
	<li>Click the 'Change Password' link in the upper right to change the admin password</li>
	<li>Add a Category using the 'Category Maintenance' link in the gCards Administration Console</li>
	<li>Add a new Card using the 'Card Maintenance' link in the gCards Administration Console</li>
	<li>Click the link in the bottom right to go to the index page of gCards - you're new Card should show up here!</li>
	<li>Done!!!</li>
</ol>

<a name="Upgrading" id="Upgrading"><h3>Upgrading gCards</h3></a>
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest gCards version from the <a href="http://www.gregphoto.net/gcards">official site</a></li>	
	<li>Read the readme to see if there are any version-specific instructions</li>
	<li>Backup your current config.php</li>
	<li>Modify the new config.php to reflect the settings in your old config.php</li>
	<li>Upload all of the files to your web host, overwriting the old files</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If you get an error trying to upload setup.php try CHMODing the file on the server to '644' first</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Run setup.php to create new database tables or to modify the existing tables to take advantage of new features</li>
</ol> 

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<a name="ImageFormat" id="ImageFormat"><h3>Image Formats</h3></a>
gCards has support for all image formats that can be displayed within an img html tag.  This would primarily be JPEGs and GIFs.
Though gCards supports GIFs, it will not automatically create thumbnails for GIF images.  This is due to the fact that gCards 
uses the GD or GD2 library to create thumbnails, and GD does not support the GIF file format due to patent issues.  If it were supported
gCards would have support for GIF thumbnail creation, but for now you'll have to live with creating your own!

<a name="Language" id="Language"><h3>Multiple Language Support</h3></a>
gCards has support for multiple languages via language files.  If multiple languages are enabled, flags
will be shown in the user interface.  When a user clicks a flag it will use that language for the
rest of the session.  Only an English version is included, though others are available at <a href="http://www.gregphoto.net/gcards/lang.php">http://www.gregphoto.net/gcards/lang.phphttp://www.gregphoto.net/gcards/lang.php</a>.  If you create files for another language please send them to me and I will include them
and give you credit!<br><br>
To create a new language file:
<ol>
	<li>Make a copy inc/lang/language_en.php</li>
	<li>Change the name of the file to reflect the language - i.e. language_sp.php for Spanish</li>
	<li>Change the text in this file to the appropriate language</li>
	<li>Open config.php and add a new value to the language array to point to your new language file.  A commented example is included in config.php</li>
	<li>Done!</li>
</ol>

<a name="Smilies" id="Smilies"><h3>Adding Extra Smilies</h3></a>
Starting with version 1.1, gCards has support for smilies :)<br>
If you'd like to modify the smilies it's pretty easy!  Here's how:
<ol>
	<li>Open inc/FCKeditor/fckconfig.js</li>
	<li>Find FCKConfig.SmileyImages at the bottom (the default path is images/siteImages/smilies/, but can be changed)</li>
	<li>Add new filenames to the array</li>
	<li>That's it!</li>
</ol>

<a name="Templates" id="Templates"><h3>Image Templates</h3></a>
Starting with version 1.2, gCards includes the images/imageTemplates directory.  This folder has
templates for various images used in gCards.  You can use these templates as a starting point for
creating smilies, new drop shadows, or stamps.

<a name="DropShadow" id="DropShadow"><h3>Drop Shadows</h3></a>
Starting with version 1.2, gCards includes an option (configurable in config.php) to use
drop shadows on image thumbnails, full-size images, and cards.  Choosing the drop shadow mode
also enables a postcard style layout that includes stamp images.<br>
The drop shadow option is simple to use if you use the default background color that ships with
gCards.  If you're using a custom color then it's a bit more difficult - the drop shadow images
include the background color on them, so you'll need to create new images.  I've provided a template
for this and instructions on how to do it in the readme in the dropshadow template directory.
<br>I tried to make a dropshadow image that would work with all backgrounds, but using a transparent
background on the image made the quality much worse....
