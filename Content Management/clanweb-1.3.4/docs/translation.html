<h2>ClanWeb translation guidelines</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This document wad created to give all the people who want to create their own
translations for our application a push in the right direction. We want to make sure
that every new translation follows a certain template so that anyone can use any translation
he or she likes without having to recode the application.
<h3>Translation guidelines</h3>
Any new file in clanadmin tools must contain this header. The header are supposed to
tell the end-user the files name, when the file was created and by who
, a email adress and finally the type of license thats implied to that file. In our
case it's a GPL license.
<h3>Header template</h3>
<code><br />
//	-----------------------------------------<br />
// 	$File: lang_main.php<br />
// 	-----------------------------------------<br />

// 	$Copyright: (c) ClanAdmin Tools 2003-2005<br />
// 	$Created: 2005-02-21 by {nickname}<br />
// 	$email: support@clanadmintools.com<br />
// 	$License: GPL - See LICENSE for more info<br />
//	-----------------------------------------<br />
</code><br />
<br />
After this header it's time to present additional information about who that created the translation,
for which version it's created, what language it's in, a mail and last modified date.
<h3>Additional information</h3>

<h3>How to translate</h3>
It's very simple to translate the entire application. Just enter your translated word 
into it's right place.
<h3>Example</h3>
<h4>English</h4>
<code>
$lang_main = "Main";<br />
$lang_news = "News";<br />
$lang_crew = "Members";<br />
</code>
<h4>Swedish</h4>
<code> 
$lang_main = "Huvudsida";<br />
$lang_news = "Nyheter";<br />
$lang_crew = "Medlemmar";<br />
</code>
<p>
Then it's just to translate all the words found in the different files in your language
folder. Don't forget to name the folder with the name of the language you've translated into. Example, 'en' for english or 'se' for swedish.
