Quick Install 

If you are familiar with installing sites, here are the quick install instructions:

1. Upload all the files to the server
2. Customize the /inc/config_cms/configuration.php file
3. Run the www.yoursite.com/subdirectory_name_if_any/db_backup/install_db.php file on the server. 
4. Use the admin panel to create new pages and edit them in an online or offline editor.  

The default login for the admin panel is admin (username) wizard (password). 

Caution: delete the /db_backup directory from the server after installation.
