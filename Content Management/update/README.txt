Thanks for using my script!

----Installation-----
1.Open update.php in notebook or dreamweaver, and edit the Config Area part. Make sure your client gets this
file.

2.Open the ck_version.php also, and edit it and put the current version, make sure you do not give this out
to your clients. This is for you to keep on your server, so the clients can check for the latest version.

3.Open version.php and put the current version where it asks, make sure your client has this, or else the
script will give him or her errors.

---Examples of how it works----
In version.php the version is 4.0.1
In ck_version.php the version is 4.0.2

It will look something like this:

                              Checked updates for the (Your Program/Script)

                                       The version you have is 4.0.1

                                      The latest version out is 4.0.2

                           A new verison is now out! You can upgrade by going here!

Remember please do not say this code is yours, I spent hours making it just for you!

Also when you let users download the new version, make sure you update version.php!

Thanks,
