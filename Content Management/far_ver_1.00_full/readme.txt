2. INSTALLATION

After you extracting files from archive, you should copy all these files on the server; 
then open the browser, write the web address there where you copied the files and 
follow the instructions of the browser.


3. REQUIREMENTS / TASKS

In order that the FARPHP project should run in most favourable conditions 
you need the following:
- a server on which runs a PHP which should be at least 4.1x version 
and a MySQL which should be at least 4.0x version
- the mail function of the php configuration should be active 
(otherwise you cant use all the facilities of the project 
(you can find other details in the guide));
- the graphic library GD should exist and be active;
- the upload function of the files should be allowed through the php scripts 
(otherwise you cant use all the facilities of the project 
(other details can be found in the guide));
- the MySQL data base should have been already created before the 
installations and when you install the program you should correctly 
specify the name of the user, the password and the name of the database;
- in the case that the configuration of the server doesnt allow the writing 
of files through php scripts, you have to write by hand the configuration 
file config.php and to save it on the server 
(you will be given further details during the installation);


4. MODIFIES OF THE VERSION

Starting with the 1.x version on code of the project was rewritten almost 
in whole and therefore all the additional modules as well as the templates 
had to be rewritten for a new version. In this new version is easier to add new 
modules and to update but this version is not compatible with the old one. 
If you have an earlier installed version, weaker than 1.x it would be better to backup 
the database before bringing up-to-date the new version 
(some tables in the database were modified and some new one were added).
In order that you should see which version do you have you can use the following link:
