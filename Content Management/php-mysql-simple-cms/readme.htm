	<li>Unpack the site to your ftp or sitefolder.</li>
	<li>Modify the config : /config.php
	<br>- Insert the correct database settings. This has to be correct before the script is able to work.
	<br>- Insert a user and password for the admin section. Never share this with anyone you don't want to be editing/deleting your data.
	<br>- Set the page color in the variable "backcolor".
	</li>
	<li>After this you have to run: /install.php . If everything is ok, your table is created. You will see a message if everything went well.
	<br>If not take a look at your config.php, make sure you spelled your database info correct.</li>
	<li>After succesfull installation of the table, you can delete the file install.php. For security reasons this is recommended.</li>
	<li>Your new cms is installed!</li>

<p style="width: 600px;">
If the script is located in a folder deeper in the sitestructure (for example http://www.yourdomain.com/newsscript/news.php)

   You will have to edit the page /admin/editor/editor.php.
   
   On the lines 409, 420, 431, 445, 456, 467, 485, 496, 510, 521, 538, 561 you'll have to change the folder. Standard the folder will be
   something like /admin/editor/images/smileys/1.gif you'll have to add your folder to it. For example if our script is located at 
   http://www.yourdomain.com/newsscript/news.php we'll have to add /newsscript before that. So we'll get :
   /newsscript/admin/editor/images/smileys/1.gif do this on all those lines.
