Title:,"Suicide rates: by gender and age, 1971 to 1997 (Selected years): Social Trends Dataset",,,,,,
Description:,"Deaths from suicide have fluctuated widely over time. The highest rates occurred around 1931 when rates for the older age groups were considerably higher than those of the youngest. There has been a marked increase in suicide death rates in people aged 15 to 24 since the end of the 1950s. Between 1971 and 1997 the suicide death rate for men aged 15 to 24 rose from 6.9 per 100,000 population in to 16.4 per 100,000 population. For women in this age group there was a fall from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, and the rate was 4.0 per 100,000 population in 1997. Suicide among men aged 25 to 44 has risen since the 1950s to a level higher than among any other group. Rates among those over the age of 44 have declined. Suicide rates are associated with mental health problems, such as depression. More detail on services for mentally ill people is contained in Table ST30816 (NHS outpatient, community and day care contacts for people with a mental illness).",,,,,,

"1 - Includes deaths undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted.  Age standardised to the European population.  To enable comparisons to be made over time which are independant of changes in the age structure of the population, directly standardised death rates have been calculated for this table.  For each year, the age-specific death rates are multiplied by the European standard population for each group.  These are then summed and divided by the total standard population to give an overall standardised rate.  Since the European population is the same for both males and females it is possible to directly compare male and female standardised death rates.  The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a coding scheme for diseases and causes of death.  The United Kingdom is currently using the Ninth Revision of the ICD (ICD9), which it has used since 1979 for coding cause of death.  The causes of death included in this table correspond to the following ICD9 codes: circulatory diseases 390-459; cancer 140-208; respiratory diseases 460-519; and infectious diseases 001-139.
