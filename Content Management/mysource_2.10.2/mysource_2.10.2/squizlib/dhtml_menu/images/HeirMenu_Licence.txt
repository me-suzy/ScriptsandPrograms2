actually that's all we want.

The link may be in your "copyright", "legal", "credits" or "about" page.
It can be as short as:

Menus by <A HREF="http://www.dhtmlab.com/">DHTML Lab</A>

In an intranet environment,or if a live link is impossible,
an acknowledgement, with the URL visible, will suffice:

"Menus by www.dhtmlab.com"

> Of course any code we use will still have your copyright notice in it.

naturally.

please let me know when you are live with HM.

Regards

Peter
