<b style="color:blue"><u>Custom actions:</u></b>
<br><br>
A custom action filename start with a "!" (top) or a "@" (bottom). A sample action filename look like this:<br>

<b><li>
!0000_NOTE_Blah_blah.txt
</b><br><br>
The numeric field is used for sorting, since WEBK sort files, you can use this number to sort your actions
in the order you want (from 0000 to 9999).<br><br>
The action field in this case is NOTE, right now WEBK support 4 different actions:<br><br>
<B>NOTE</b>	: Create a notice on the page, the file data is used as multi-lines note.<br>
<b>HTML</B>  : Create raw HTML on the page, the file data is used as raw HTML data.<br>
<b>NEWS</b>  : Create a news on the page, the file data is used for the news, <br><br>
<i style=color:darkblue>first line: TITLE,<br>
second line: AUTHOR,<br>
third line and other: content<br><br></i><br>
<b>UPLOAD</b>	: Create a upload box on the page, the file data is not used, you can upload files on the current page, not secure since you can upload custom action files :)<br>
<br>

The last field is not used, its for you, use it to remember the content without having to check inside.
