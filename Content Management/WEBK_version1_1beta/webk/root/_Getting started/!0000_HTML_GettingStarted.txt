<b><u style=color:blue>STEP #1 : Pre-installation requirements</u></b>
<br><br>
WEBK need these software requirements:
<br><br><b>
<LI>A web server like APACHE or IIS (I never tested WEBK on a windows http server, if you do, inform me please)
<LI>PHP 4.3.0+ (You can try with 4.2 or even 4.0 but I assume you have a recent version installed)
<LI>PHP GD2 Module 

</b>
<br><br>

What you don't need: <b>A database like MYSQL</b>
<br><br>

<b><u style=color:blue>STEP #2 : Download and installation</u></b>
<br><br>
Download WEBK from the DOWNLOAD section, in the zip file you will have 2 folders:
<br>
<b>
<li>Folder: htdocs<br></b>
This is your public web folder, the folder everyone can see from the web. This folder must be readable but do not
need to be writable by the http server process. IE: /var/www/htdocs
<br>
<b><li>Folder: webk<br></b>
This is the private WEBK folder, the folder nobody see from the web. This folder must be readable and WRITEABLE
by the http server process. IE: /var/www/webk
<br><br>	


<b><u style=color:blue>STEP #3 : Configuration</u></b>
<br><br>
Edit the file in webk/include folder named config.inc.php

Change theses four lines to reflect your actual path configuration:
<b><br><br>
<li>define ("PATH_WEB", "/www/vhosts/webk.zapto.org/htdocs/");<br>
<li>define ("PATH_ROOT", "/www/vhosts/webk.zapto.org/webk/root/");<br>
<li>define ("PATH_TEMPLATE", "/www/vhosts/webk.zapto.org/webk/template/default/");<br>
<li>define ("PATH_INCLUDE", "/www/vhosts/webk.zapto.org/webk/include/");<br>
</b><br><br>

<b><u style=color:blue>STEP #4 : Enjoy it</u></b>
<br><br>
Your WEBK website is supposed to be 100% working by now. If you want to learn how to craft special files
,customize the theme or even create some new modules/plugins go to support section.
