WEBK is a filesystem oriented web content delivery system, WHAT? To simplify, its a system to create
website without having to develop or design HTML pages. <BR><BR>
The idea is simple: You create files and folders
with custom names then WEBK generate pages accordingly.<br><br>

Lets see an example, I have a root folder containing 4 items:
<br><br><b>
<li>Item 1: A folder named "_Hello this is a menu"
<li>Item 2: A file named "blah.txt" containing this data: "This is a dumb textfile"
<li>Item 3: A file named "!0000_NOTE_blah.txt" contaning this data: "Hello folks"
<li>Item 4: a folder named "This is a folder"
<br><br>	</b>
WEBK will generate this:
