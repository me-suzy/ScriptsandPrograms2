Hello $username

You are receiving this email because you have (or someone pretending to be you has) requested a new password be sent for your account on {$config['troopname']}. If you did not request this email then please ignore it (But, your password has been changed), if you keep receiving it please contact the webmaster.

You will now be able to login using the following information:

--------------------------
Username: $username
Password: $password
--------------------------

You can of course change this password yourself via the profile page. If you have any difficulties please contact the webmaster.
