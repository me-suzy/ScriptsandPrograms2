<p>You might be asking yourself, &quot;What is CMScout?&quot;</p>
<p>CMScout is a CMS (Content management system) for scouting related groups from around the world. A CMS is a piece of web software that makes it easy for you to install, and manage a website. CMScout includes all the features of other major CMS's that are available (Like PHP-Nuke, Mambo, e107, etc.).</p>
