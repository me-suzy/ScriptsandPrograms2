	      <h1><b>To Do List</b></h1>
	    </div>
		<ul>
	      <li>Add a news letter tool:
		<ul>
		  <li> Add subscribed / unsubscribed block to the main function
		    library.</li>
		  <li> Subscriber list import and export.</li>
		  <li> HTML newsletter.</li>
		  <li> Include attachments with mailings.</li>
		  <li> Limit emails per day, week, or month.</li>
		  <li> Adjust sending speed/quantity/delay.</li>
		  <li> Remove duplicate entries.</li>
		  <li> Test sends before sending a list.</li>
		  <li> Add unsubscribed link automatically to the bottom of the
		    newsletter.</li>
		  <li> Automatically thank you email on user subscribes.</li>
		  <li> Bounce management (remove bad addresses) by verifying email
		    address using function (JS &amp; PHP).</li>
		  <li> Unsubscribed list: all users who have unsubscribed are
		    marked as unsubscribed users (script will not delete their
		    email addresses).</li>
		  <li> Use auto refresh feature to handle huge subscriber lists
		    applying the following scenario:
		    <ul>
		      <li> Send newsletter to a restricted group of subscriber
			(definition send by GET method, that contain position
			and size).</li>
		      <li> That page will view a progress bar calculated using
			total count of subscriber, current position, and size.</li>
		      <li> Set automatically the refresh tag to be called after
			few seconds for the same page but new position (current
			position + size).</li>
		      <li> Pause, Resume, or stop mailings.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li> Track how many readers open / read your mail and who does
		    this. To do so tool have to add automatically one pixel image
		    call PHP script passing the user id (you can get more description
		    by analyze log file for that requested image like country
		    distribution and day/time of requests, etc&#8230;). that hidden
		    image call could be some thing like this:<br>
		    &lt;img src=&quot;track.php?id=#&quot; width=&quot;1&quot;
		    height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</li>
		  <li> Suggested subscriber table structure is:<br>
		    id (auto increment), email (as a varchar field), views (integer
		    field), and create (as a UNIX time stamp).<br>
		    &nbsp; </li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li> Undo / Redo logic to the SQL database interface, main algorithm
		descried here:
		<ul>
		  <li> We have to have 3 log files will named as the following:
		    sql.log  undo.log  redo.log</li>
		  <li> Steps to execute an add SQL statement:
		    <ul>
		      <li> Execute that SQL statement on our database.</li>
		      <li> If we get an error, print error message then exit this
			procedure.</li>
		      <li> Save that SQL statement in the sql.log file.</li>
		      <li> Get the id of the current inserted record.</li>
		      <li> Prepare a new SQL statement to delete that exact record,
			and save that statement in the undo.log file.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li> Steps to execute a delete SQL statement:
		    <ul>
		      <li> Save that SQL statement in the sql.log file.</li>
		      <li> Get all information / data of the record that we are
			going to delete (select command using same where section).</li>
		      <li> Prepare an add SQL statement could insert that record
			again in the database (including set the original id value).</li>
		      <li> Execute the original SQL statement (delete statement) 
			on our database.</li>
		      <li> If we get an error, print error message then exit this 
			procedure.</li>
		      <li> Save that SQL statement in the sql.log file.</li>
		      <li> Save that prepared add SQL statement in the undo.log 
			file.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li> Steps to execute a update SQL statement: 
		    <ul>
		      <li> Get the original data of the fields that we are going 
			to update (select command using same where section).</li>
		      <li> Prepare a new update SQL statement that can return 
			this record to its original case.</li>
		      <li> Execute the original update SQL statement on our database.</li>
		      <li> If we get an error, print error message then exit this 
			procedure.</li>
		      <li> Save that SQL statement in the sql.log file.</li>
		      <li> Save that prepared update SQL statement in the undo.log 
			file.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li> Steps to execute undo action (this function will not be 
		    active when undo.log file is empty): 
		    <ul>
		      <li> Pick up the last inserted SQL statement to the undo.log 
			file (remove it from that log file).</li>
		      <li> Execute this SQL statement on our database.</li>
		      <li> Pick up the last inserted SQL statement to the sql.log 
			file (remove it from that log file also).</li>
		      <li> Save this SQL statement into redo.log file.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li> Steps to execute redo action: 
		    <ul>
		      <li> Pick up the last inserted SQL statement to the redo.log 
			file (remove it from that log file).</li>
		      <li> Execute that SQL statement in the normal way throw 
			the logic for add, edit, and delete SQL statement that 
			explained previously in this document.</li>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li> Very important notification: this explained logic is really 
		    simple one but it is fair enough to be used in Khaled CMS 
		    system. But I have to refer here in this document to the limitation
		    of like this logic and how you can come over it (if you really 
		    need that advanced feature in your database). We suppose that 
		    delete and update SQL statement will affect one record in 
		    the database (in our case it is page id). But in general case 
		    one delete or update command may affect more than one record, 
		    which meaning more than one SQL statement in the undo log 
		    file to undo the action taken. In like that cases you have 
		    to add an extra mechanism to grouping related SQL statements
		    together (by adding same id number to the SQL statement line 
		    in the log file for an example).<br>
		    &nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li> Convert back end code to use OOP technologies using <a href="http://phpcodegenie.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">phpCodeGenie</a>
		tool.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	      <li>Add kind of system wizard to create a different type of websites using
	      restore feature and set of manual prepared structures. This can be adding
	      as an additional page to the system documentation.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>

	      <li>Offline site generator based on XML formate of the backup/restore function.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>

	      <li> Add a JavaScript menu to the website header. That menu will
		use some JavaScript's libraries in addition to build menu configuration
		file automatically (just like meta script). In each page in the
		CMS system we have to add the following inputs:
		<ul>
		  <li> Check box ask user if (s)he want to browse that page in
		    the main menu bar.</li>
		  <li> Combo box refer to the nested level of links related to
		    that page presented in the menu structure (default = 1). </li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
