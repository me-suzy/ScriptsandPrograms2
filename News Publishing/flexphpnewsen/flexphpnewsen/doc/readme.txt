FlexPHPNews is a simple, free and open source website news admin system. You can add multi-level sub-categories and upload pictures for the news. All the text in this program is put in one file. Once you edit this file, you can generate a new language version or customize the text in your program. Users can search the contents of the news by keywords and rate for the news.
