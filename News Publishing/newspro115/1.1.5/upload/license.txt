<strong>LICENSE AGREEMENT</strong><br /><br />

Utopia News Pro ('UNP') is a copyrighted work of authorship and is also protected under applicable database laws. UtopiaSoftware retains ownership of UNP and any copies of it, regardless of the form in which the copies may exist. This free licence is not a sale of the original UNP or any copies.<br /><br />

By installing and using Utopia News Pro on your server, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Such agreement is either on your own behalf or on behalf of any corporate entity which employs you or which you represent ('Corporate Licensee'). In this Agreement, 'you' includes both the reader and any Corporate Licensee:<br /><br />

A UNP licence grants you the right to run an unlimited number of UNP installations on an unlimited number of servers. You may not rent, lease, sublicence, sell, assign, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of UNP in any form, on a temporary or permanent basis, without the prior written consent of UtopiaSoftware.
The licence is effective indefinitely unless terminated by UtopiaSoftware for any reason.<br /><br />

You undertake to ensure that, prior to use of UNP by your employees or agents, all such parties are notified of the terms of this Agreement<br />
If, in the event that UtopiaSoftware terminates your license, all copies of UNP must either be removed from the server, or another licence created.
UNP source code may be altered ('hacked'), at your risk; however, UNP support staff will not give support to hacked files.<br /><br />

All UtopiaSoftware copyright notices within design templates must remain unchanged and visible.<br /><br />

UNP may not be used for anything that would represent or is associated with an Intellectual Property violation, including, but not limited to, engaging in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, software piracy, and patents held by individuals, corporations, or other entities.<br /><br />

If any of the terms of this Agreement are violated, UtopiaSoftware reserves the right to revoke the licence at any time.<br /><br />

<strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</strong><br /><br />

The software and the accompanying files are distributed "As Is" and without warranties as to performance of merchantability or any other warranties whether expressed or implied.<br /><br />

UtopiaSoftware is not liable for the content of any news posted on a site powered by UNP.<br /><br />

UtopiaSoftware cannot be held responsible and accepts no liability for any failure in transmission by you and where for whatever reason your transmission is corrupted fails to arrive or arrives after an undue delay or is received in an unintelligible form.<br /><br />

You must assume the entire risk of using the program. Any liability of UtopiaSoftware will be limited exclusively to product replacement.<br /><br />

Except in respect of personal injury or death caused directly by the negligence of UtopiaSoftware, in no event will UtopiaSoftware be liable to you for any damages, including any lost profits, lost savings, loss of data or any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use UNP, even if UtopiaSoftware has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Nothing in this Agreement limits liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.<br /><br />

This licence gives you specific legal rights and you may have other rights that vary from country to country. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, or certain kinds of limitations or exclusions of liability, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you. Other jurisdictions allow limitations and exclusions subject to certain conditions. In such a case the above limitations and exclusions shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such applicable jurisdictions. If any part of the above limitations or exclusions is held to be void of unenforceable, such part shall be deemed to be deleted from this agreement and the remainder of the limitation or exclusion shall continue in full force and effect. Any rights that you may have as a consumer (i.e. a purchaser for private as opposed to business, academic or government use) are not affected.<br /><br />

UtopiaSoftware reserves the right to modify these terms at any time.<br /><br />

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States of America and Canada.
