SAXON 4.5: whats-new.txt
30 September 2005

Fixed a reported security bug on login whereby someone logging in using a login name of:

' or isnull(1/0) /*

could gain illegal access when magic_quotes was turned off.
I couldn't actually replicate this myself (with or without magic_quotes) but login names are now strictly limited 
to alphanumeric characters. No punctuation and no whitespace.
Affected files:
functions.php
admin/add-user.php

Post dated items now available:
Add a news item for next week (or next year) and it won't appear on your site, or in your RSS feed, 
until the appropriate date.

List news items:
List all items currently in the database - including post dated articles.

Preview news:
Jump direct to your main news page (uses path settings within config.php)

Fake cron:
On the first user visit to the main news page each day, a fake cron function will check to see if there 
are any articles in the database scheduled for release. These articles will be automatically published on 
the main news page and a new RSS feed generated. If the fake cron function fails for any reason, the 
SAXON administrator will be emailed automatically.
If you don't want to make use of the fake cron for some reason, there is an option to switch it off. 
See readme.txt for further information.

Formatting:
Removed the bug that added <br /> to end of lines when creating eye-readable markup and, in the 
process, added a more intelligent markup function that should respect all block level XHTML tags.

Illegal character clean-up:
Correct encoding of common "illegal" characters when displaying news on a web page or publishing an RSS feed.

Allow SAXON tables to have prefixes:
Now you can have multiple instances of SAXON pulling from a single database.

User Passwords:
Allow SAXON users to automatically email the SAXON administrator to request a new password if they 
have problems logging in.
