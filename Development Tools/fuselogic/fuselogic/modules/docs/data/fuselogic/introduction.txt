==== Application Framework ====

Fuselogic is Application Framework, not Content Management System :).
The idea of having Framework is to give a solid foundation to make application.
In FuseLogi Website application is divide in the module. Each module will do "certain task" only.
A good example is "session module". When you want to use File based session or Database session, what you have to do is change some setting in the "session module". You don't have to do anything to others modules. The other modules doesn't know at all about this change.

==== Feutures ====

1) Single point of entry (index.php).

2) Directory friendly.

3) Multi domain friendly. Very usefull for virtual domain and Wild Cards DNS.

4) Friendly URL

5) Stable code using an automated testing environment (UnitTest)
