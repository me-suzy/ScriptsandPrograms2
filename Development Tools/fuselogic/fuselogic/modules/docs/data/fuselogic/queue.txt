====== Queue ======

Queue is the most confusing and the most powerfull thing in FuseLogic.
I you by Ticket in "Cinema" that playing "box office" movie most of the time you need to queue your self in front of "ticket counter". Which mean **"First Come, get service First by the counter"**. This thing also hapen in FuseLogic. You can not run fuse direcly but you need to insert the fuse in the FuseLogic Queuing system by using command Queue("fuse/name").


For Example:


Queue('init/one');

Queue('init/two');

Queue('init/three');

Will be executed by FuseLogic as follow:

**Run fuse 'init/one';

Run fuse 'init/two';

Run fuse 'init/three';

**

----
**API**

**Queue**(string $fuse_name);

**Queue**(string $fuse_name, string $layout_name);

**$fuse_name:** the name of fuse you want to insert in the FuseLogic Queue system

**$layout_name (optional)**: Name of Layout you want to put all the string produce by fuse

**Example:** 

Queue('display/left'); 

Queue('display/left','left_menu')
