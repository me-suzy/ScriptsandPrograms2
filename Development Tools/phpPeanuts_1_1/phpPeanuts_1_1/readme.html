<OL>
	<LI>Errorlog now includes http referrer
</OL>

<P>Since 1.1 beta 1:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Evaluating php source from session apears to be seen as a security hazard according to www.php.net, annoucement
	of php version 4.3.10. pnt.web.PntSite::getGlobalFilters now instantiates filter from array instead of evaluating
	php source from session.
	<LI>folder for skins, widgets and most base classes can now be overriden
</OL>

<P>Several bugs and notifications fixed, see <A HREF="http://www.phppeanuts.org/site/index_php/Pagina/176/version+1.1+beta+1.html">the
list on the bugs section of the website</A></P>
<P>In 1.1 beta 1 Since phpPeanuts 1.0a:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Null values can now be stored for number, date, time and timestamp datatypes. The user interface framework
	has allways converted empty strings entered by the user into null values and set those on the corresponding properties
	of the updated or created object, but now the persistancy framework really tries to store these null values into
	the database. If the columns in which these null values are to be stored are specified als NOT NULL, query errors
	will be the result. To prevent this you need to check all table definitions of existing applications to match with
	settings for the minLength of the corresponding propertyDescriptors: Where null is not allowed, minLength should
	be set to a number larger then 0. This will make the framework report a proper error to the user and let the user
	correct the value he entered or selected. See <A HREF="http://www.phppeanuts.org/site/index_php/Pagina/175">how
	to convert and validate user input</A>. Where null should be allowed, the database table should be modified accordingly.
	Be aware that MySql versions prior 3.23.2 can not index columns with null values. See <A HREF="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Problems_with_NULL.html">problems
	with null values</A> in the MySql documentation. If do not (allways) want the framework to convert empty strings
	to null values, you may override the <A HREF="http://www.phppeanuts.org/site/index.php?pntType=HcodeMethod&amp;id=pnt.web.PntStringConverter::convert">convert
	method</A> on class <A HREF="http://www.phppeanuts.org/site/index.php?pntType=HcodeClass&amp;id=StringConverter">StringConverter</A>.
	If this solution does not work for you, please ask for alternatives on the forum.
	<LI>Select and Dialog widgets now will prevent the removal of a value if the corresponding propertyDescriptor or
	id-propertyDescriptor's minLength is larger then 0. In older releases minValue was used for this, but that was
	not consistent with form validation. You may have to check propertyDescriptors in exesting applications for this
	in order to get the expected behavior with the new version of the framework,
	<LI>Sql files for the examples now create tables according to the properperty descriptors in the new examples code.
	When upgrading exisiting examples you should re-run the sql files needed for those examples.
	<LI>HorizontalTablePart that lists peanuts horizontally (one peanut per column) and properties vertically (one
	property per row),
	<LI>SearchPage now includes support for the application of a global filter, see the new version of example 9
	<LI>Polymorphic persistancy, see example 12
	<LI>Support for multi value properties in navigational queries,
	<LI>No more notifications triggered by the framework and the examples
	<LI>Support for time datatype
	<LI>ErrorHandler now properly handles errors in the ErrorPage, thus avoinding endlessly looping
	<LI>ErrorHandler level for logging can now be set seperately
	<LI>classes/dateFunction.php is no longer included.
</OL>

<P>
<H3>Known bugs</H3>

<OL>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.phppeanuts.org/site/index.php?pntType=Pagina&amp;id=108">Column mappings</A> may not be
	consequently applied. If you need to set a columnName different to the propertyName on an PropertyDescriptor, test
	your applications database persistence functionality thouroughly.
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.phppeanuts.org/site/index.php?pntType=Pagina&amp;id=167">Reference Anomalies</A>: Before
	the generic workaround was applied, use of references by phpPeanuts occasionally made uninitialized php variables
	or associations arbitrarily hold values that seemed to come from another variable. This rarily happened and since
	the generic workaround it never happend again, so we recon this issue closed. However, it is impossible to guarantee
	that the problem has been eliminated once and for all. Do not use phpPeanuts for mission critical applications.
	<LI>Does not work with php5. An upgrade to a portable version functionally equal to 1.1 beta 2 is available.
</OL>
