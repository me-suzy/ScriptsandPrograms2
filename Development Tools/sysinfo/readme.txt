SysInfo Version 1

Based on several other people's codes (Thanks guys!)

¤ About this script:
This is probably one of the more comprehensive System
Information scripts out there.  Please note that you MUST
have PHP installed on your site in order to run this
script properly.  It utilizes both PHP and Javascripting
to return system information based on the end user's browser.
It does not send any information to the web server itself.

¤ IMPORTANT INFORMATION!
You will notice that there's an OnLoad parameter in the body
tag.  This MUST remain in place or your visitors will get a
JavaScript error.  Also, when you upload this page, you must
upload it as an ASCII file.  The file must end in a .php or
.php3 extension.  There are PHP coding tags in this that will
not work properly if given a different file extension.

¤ Planned in future releases:
I'll add in additional system information, such as History length,
past history, number of cookies, MIME types, plug-ins installed, more...

¤ Link-backs
I tweaked this and made it so that you can virtually incorporate
this into any kind of a site.  By using this script, you agree
to leave the linkback to TheRealms.net.  Failure to do so will
provide me with recourse to send you a bill for removing the linkback.
I can and WILL find scripts that I write that aren't linked back to me.  :)

¤ About me.

addict as well as a Fractured.net and IRC addict.
