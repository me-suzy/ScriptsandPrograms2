I think that your selection of Smarty was very \"smart\" ;-)
I\'m planning to use OpenBiz. I would apreciate if you could improve the documentation/examples regarding access control. 
Thanks.

But I learned that ADOdb does not suport PHP5, which is the future. PHP4 is a legendary, used for amateur web developers. PHP will be chose by enterprise because of its strong OOP model and other nice features.

Tell me if I am wrong.

Thanks and best regards,

But how implement reports in OpenBiz?
There are any future plan to do it?<br>Email: paulovaz2000@yahoo.com.br<hr>03/Jul/2004:02:37:03<br>Like it: Please select<br>Want to use it: Please select<br>Comments: I am trying to run openbiz on windows 32 machine. I keep getting the following error Warning: array_keys(): The first argument should be an array in C:\\Program Files\\Apache Group\\Apache2\\htdocs\\evtmgr\\bin\\system.php on line 257

Could you point in the right direction to clear up this error. The product looks good if I could just get it to run.

Thanks
