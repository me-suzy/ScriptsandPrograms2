Duncan Carver's - Link Management Assistant - Enhancement Add Ons
************************************************************************

The files in this directory contain useful add-ons that enhance the
functionality of the Link Management Assistant. Please read the
respective installation instructions below for the add-on you would like
to incorporate...


************************************************************************
Link Management Assistant Templates
************************************************************************

In the "templates" in this section you'll find 3 different templates
which you can use for your niche website directory. Please feel free to
customize these to suit. You'll find detailed instructions on using them
in the associated README file in that folder.


************************************************************************
Listing URL & Category Association Export
************************************************************************

This add-on allows you to export all listing URL's in your niche website
directory, and the associated directory locations (i.e. the complete URL
to their listing location in your directory) into a ; delimited txt file.

If you own the "Affiliate Finder Pro" application...

http://www.affiliatefinderpro.com/swres/cbdcam.html

...which I highly recommend, you'll then be able to import all of the
URL's from your directory into "Affiliate Finder" Pro and collect the
contact information for about 60-70% of the website owners in a matter
of minutes.

You can then import that information into your mailing list management
application and email all website owners to let them know they've been
listed in your directory & show them exactly where.

You could also offer to "up their listing" to "premium" status which
would put them in the top of their category if they link back to you,
to increase your incoming link popularity.

NOTE: You may need to use a spreadsheet application (i.e. Excel) to
modify the output file this add-on generates to make it compatible
with the Affiliate Finder Pro import feature. Please seek support from
the Affiliate Finder Pro people on using their import feature if you
cannot work out how to do this yourself.

TIP: You need to get the location of their listing in your website
directory into the respective "comment" field of Affiliate Finder Pro
in order to keep these two pieces of information together.

Add-On Files:
**************

* export.php


**************
Installation:
**************

Simply upload the export.php file into the main LMA installation
directory on your website server.


**************
Instructions:
**************

To run the export feature login to the Link Management Assistant admin
area and type the following in your browser...

http://www.domain.com/lma/export.php

...where domain.com is your domain, and LMA is the folder where you've
installed the main application into, and hit the enter key on your
keyboard to load the file.

Let the browser process this file (the time it takes depends on the
number of listings in your directory and your category structure). Once
completed you will see a message saying "All Done".

The export add-on has now generated a text file database in the same
main LMA application folder called export.txt containing the data. FTP
into your website server and download this file to your desktop for
manipulation.
