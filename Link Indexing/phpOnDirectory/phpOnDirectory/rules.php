        <p>You are invited to place your link on our online dating directory.

                  We ask in return that you include a link back to the directory

                  from an indexed HTML page on your site. </p>

                <p>To qualify for inclusion in the directory, your site should

                  meet the following criteria:</p>

                <hr>

                <p><em>You must place a link back to us using one of our supplied

                  links, on an indexed page no further than 1 click from the home

                  page of the site to be listed.</em></p>

                <p><em> You must not be an affiliate site (such that your data

                  comes from another sites' database or you drive users to another

                  site).</em></p>

                <p><em>Sites must contain a reasonable amount of content (i.e.

                  adverts) to be eligible for listing. We only list dating and

                  related romance sites. Adult contacts sites must be tasteful.

                  No porn sites.  </em></p>

                <p><em>To be listed under 100% free, you MUST be 100% free for

                  ALL services that you provide in relation to the site you are

                  listing.</em></p>

                <p><em>Sites must be listed under their own single domain rather

                  than a) spread across multiple domains or b) a sub-domain of

                  a free hosting service (such as tripod, angelfire, geocities

                  etc.)</em></p>

                <p><em>Sites must provide a good user experience and not include

                  multiple pop-ups, music, unasked for installations or pages

                  that cannot be exited. </em></p>

                <hr>

                <p>If your site does not meet the criteria above then please do

                  not apply. We only list high quality sites that give our visitors

                  useful information or content.
