<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>What is the difference between an &quot;album&quot; and a &quot;gallery&quot;?</b><br>
&quot;Album&quot; and &quot;Gallery&quot; are simply terms we use to show the difference between top level categories and sub-level categories.  Albums are the top-level categories which can contain individual galleries, allowing you to quickly and easily organize your images.
