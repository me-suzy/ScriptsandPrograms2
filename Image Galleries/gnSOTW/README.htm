<p><strong>INSTALLATION<br>
</strong>To install the script, edit config.php and then upload all files. Go
to http://yoursite.com/installer.php. I reccomend uploading this into the main
directory unlessyou know what your doing and care to edit the <em>include</em>'s
in the script. Make sure you set the right permissions as well. After you are
done installing you should remove the installer.php but you do not have to. </p>
