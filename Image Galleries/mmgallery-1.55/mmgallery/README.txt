Installation

*** ATTENTION *** IF YOU ARE UPGRADING from a previous version: some function names have changed, a new page was added and other code was modified. So upgrade is not automatic! (i.e. you can't simply update functions.inc) You have to work a bit on it.

1) Create as many subdirectories as you want to place the images. The directories names can't have spaces in them, use "_" instead.
   For example:

                |-- My_photos_1/
	             |        |--------- thumb.jpg
                |        |--------- thumbs/
   mmgallery/ --|-- My_photos_2/
                |        |--------- thumb.jpg
	             |        |--------- thumbs/
                |-- My_photos_3/
	             |        |--------- thumb.jpg
                |        |--------- thumbs/
                |-- ...

2) For each subdirectory create a thumbnail and put in it. The thumbnail must be named 'thumb.jpg'. This thumb will be used as representative for the entire gallery (directory) in the main page.
The reason because mmgallery doesn't automatically pick a thumb from the "thumbs" directory is that you could want to use a particular image.
   
3) For each subdirectory create a directory "thumbs" and put in it all the thumbnails for the current gallery.

4) In the main directory ("mmgallery" in the example) put the script files.

5) Modify 'index.php' line 50. The function show_thumbs($cols, $th_width, $th_height, $cellpadding, $cellspacing) shows the thumbs in a table with '$cols' columns. '$th_width' and '$th_height' are the dimensions of the thumbnails. '$cellpadding' and '$cellspacing' refer to the table properties.
Ditto for show_thumbs(...) in 'thumbs.php' at line 50. 

6) Customize 'index.php', 'thumbs.php" and 'show.php' as you like.

7) When you show a full size image, automatic resize will decrease it if its dimensions are bigger than browser/screen's one.
If you don't want this open 'resize.js' and at line 26 change "yes" with "no".

8) Set options at line 25 (and following) of 'functions.inc' or leave as they are if don't need them.

9) Enjoy it!
