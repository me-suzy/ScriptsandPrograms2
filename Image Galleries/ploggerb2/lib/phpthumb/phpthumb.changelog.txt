//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

v1.4.11 - October 11, 2004
  * Changed sx/sy/sw/sh parameters to allow decimal values
    (>0 but <1) to represent percent of source image
    (thanks mordorØdefault*co*yu)
  * Added config_error_silent_die_on_error for no-output
    die on fatal errors (thanks johannesØformformat*se)
  * Bugfix: Check `which convert` failing with error
    message (thanks chadØchadshome*com)
  * Bugfix: Image cropping to invalid areas outside source
    image caused text output (thanks mordorØdefault*co*yu)

v1.4.10 - August 22, 2004
  * Bugfix: cached files not written in most cases
    (thanks kizerØcourtkizer*com, snuffØinbox*ru)
  * Bugfix: ApacheLookupURIarray() crashes in CGI mode
    (thanks hanskrentelØyahoo*de)
  * Bugfix: phpthumb_bmpfile2gd() was broken
    (thanks iØmindlace*net)

v1.4.9 - August 9, 2004
  * Bugfix: changed destination filename in RenderToFile()
    (thanks alextkØwalla*com)
  * Bugfix: problems with HTTP image source when called as
    an object (thanks alextkØwalla*com)

v1.4.8 - August 4, 2004
  * $this->error has changed to $this->errors and is now
    an array of strings (instead of a single string)
  * A lot more error conditions (invalid cache directory,
    etc) are now reported in $this->errors
    (thanks aidan*slingsbyØlineone*net)
  * Removed all define(CONSTANT) in the phpThumb()
    constructor - you can now access:
    - PHPTHUMB_VERSION   == $this->phpthumb_version;
    - PHPTHUMB_OSSLASH   == $this->osslash;
    - PHPTHUMB_ISWINDOWS == $this->iswindows;
  * Bugfix: Error message from apache_lookup_uri() failing
    under Apache2 now reported cleanly
    (thanks derbaffØyahoo*com)
  * Bugfix: missing phpthumb_functions:: class name for
    ImageTypeToMIMEtype() call in ExtractEXIFgetImageSize()
    (thanks aidan*slingsbyØlineone*net)
  * Bugfix: ImageTypeToMIMEtype() was broken for PHP older
    than v4.3.0  (thanks georg*schreiberØbatch-pc*es)
  * Bugfix: RenderToFile() now returns false if it fails
    (thanks phpthumbØsendthemtomir*com)
  * Bugfix: Corrupt JPEG/PNG/GIF files that failed
    ImageCreateFrom*() were not being passed to ImageMagick
    for fallback, nor passed through unmodified if IM was
    unavailable or failed  (thanks r*chongØmogenic*net)
  * Bugfix: Improved backtick safe-mode limit detection
    (thanks 1Øadamcarrington*com)
  * Bugfix: EXIF thumbnails were being used as source when
    they should not be  (thanks aidan*slingsbyØlineone*net)
  * Bugfix: Cached files were not being created or used
    properly  (thanks aidan*slingsbyØlineone*net)
  * Bugfix: max_source_pixels not set correct on some PHP
    versions  (thanks derbaffØyahoo*com)
  * Bugfix: 'down' parameter ignored for unprocessed and
    cached files  (thanks aidan*slingsbyØlineone*net)

v1.4.7 - July 27, 2004
  * Included a modified version of "module.graphic.bmp.php"
    from getID3() [http://getid3.sourceforge.net] as
    "phpthumb.bmp.php" for BMP reading support without
    ImageMagick. It works, but it's *very* slow, especially
    for large images (as in 640x480 or larger).
  * Added check to prevent error messages when shell_exec
    is disabled (thanks webmasterØneester*com)

v1.4.6 - July 22, 2004
  * Added new section to phpthumb.config.php where you can
    easily specify defaults for any parameter you can set
    in the URL. Normally URL parameters override these
    default values, unless you set
    $PHPTHUMB_DEFAULTS_GETSTRINGOVERRIDE to false
  * Renamed phpthumb.config.php to phpThumb.config.php
    since it's part of phpThumb.php, not part of
    phpthumb.class.php (change of case only, will not
    affect Windows servers, but will affect *nix)
  * Changed cached filename of rawImageData-source images
    from urlencode('') to md5(rawImageData). This should
    make caching thumbnails from non-file sources more
    reliable.
  * Added ImageMagick debugging information
  * Removed unneccesary default values from cached
    filenames. This may invalidate some previously cached
    files. phpthumb.demo.cacheconvert.php has been updated
    to handle v1.4.1-1.4.5 => v1.4.6+ cache filenames.
  * Bugfix: Cached filename did not have file-modified
    datestamp when used as implmented in phpThumb.php
  * Bugfix: RenderToFile() now accepts relative filenames
    (thanks aidan*slingsbyØlineone*net)
  * Bugfix: AllowOutputEnlargment setting was ignored when
    falling back to ImageMagick
  * Bugfix: IgnoreAspectRatio setting was ignored when
    falling back to ImageMagick
  * Bugfix: config_temp_directory was ignored in gd_info()
    in PHP < v4.3.0 when phpinfo() returns no GD
    information (due to safe mode restrictions)
    (thanks mimyrtekØmyrtek*com)

v1.4.5 - June 28, 2004
  * Added new parameter 'down' where you can specify a
    filename and OutputThumbnail() will cause the file
    to be downloaded rather than displayed in the browser.
    Demo images on silisoftware.com/scripts/phpThumb/demo/
    can all be downloaded to show off this feature.
    (thanks stuartscrumpØyahoo*co*uk)
  * Added ability to remove old files from cache directory
    based on last-access time and/or number of cached files
    and/or total size of cached files
    (thanks jrmhaigØyahoo*co*uk)
  * Added public CleanUpCacheDirectory() for cache cleaning
    (see above) if you need to call it manually
  * Included new file phpThumb.demo.cacheconvert.php to
    convert old-style cache names to the current (and
    hopefully last!) standard naming convention.
    (thanks joshgØtwcny*rr*com)
  * Added configuration value 'document_root' for rare case
    when $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] return incorrect value
    (thanks joshgØtwcny*rr*com)
  * Now tries to create thumbnail with ImageMagick if
    ImageCreateFromJPEG etc fails, before falling back to
    outputting unmodified source data.
  * Bugfix: HTTP image sources were broken
    (thanks fritz*weisshartØt-online*de)
  * Bugfix: ImageMagick callout wasn't being used if EXIF
    thumbnail was available
    (thanks joshgØtwcny*rr*com)
  * Bugfix: HTTP src with space in filename was broken
    (thanks drØrhodes360*com)
  * Bugfix: version_compare_replacement() was broken for
    PHP v4.1.0+

v1.4.4 - June 8, 2004
  * Bugfix: network-share (Windows) source filenames were
    not possible. Now works, but you must use the network
    name and not a mapped drive name, for example:
    \\othercomputer\file.jpg - good
    \\192.168.2.1\file.jpg - good
    z:\file.jpg - won't work
    This is a PHP limitation (see www.php.net/file-exists)
    Note: you may want to use "/" slashes instead of "\" if
    you have magic_quotes_gpc enabled to avoid stripslashes
    problems.
    (thanks drØrhodes360*com)
  * Bugfix: missing "phpthumb_functions::" in
    ImageCreateFromStringReplacement()
    (thanks zapletalØsoftwaremedia*cz)

v1.4.3 - May 25, 2004
  * Added new configuration variable 'config_temp_directory'
    to allow you to specify a writable directory name for
    temp files if you do not have access to the system temp
    directory on your server (Safe Mode restrictions etc)
    (thanks nickØregenmag*com)
  * Added new configuration variable
    'config_error_die_on_error' which can be set to false if
    you want to retrieve the error message without having it
    dumped as an image - the error message is now available
    in $phpThumb->error
  * Images are passed through directly with no processing
    and no caching if no parameters are passed to alter the
    image (resize, crop, sharpening, etc)
    (thanks nchmuraØusers*sourceforge*net)
  * Added new configuration variable 'config_disable_debug'
    which disabled phpThumbDebug from working if you have
    security concerns about the displayed information
  * Bugfix: Added detection at the top of phpThumb.php for
    no-GD errors to avoid parse errors later in the code
    (thanks nickØregenmag*com)
  * Bugfix: RoundedImageCorners() had some off-by-1 errors
    (thanks ola*thunbergØhome*se)

v1.4.2 - May 10, 2004
  * Added IE-compatability mode for transparent corners
    (set 'bct=256')
  * Bugfix: version_compare_replacement() was broken in PHP
    older than 4.1.0
    (thanks nickØregenmag*com)

v1.4.1.1 - May 9, 2004
 * Bugfix: Removed ImageTrueColorToPalette hack.
   See http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=28341
 * Bugfix: 'maxb' option for PNG/GIF output incorrect
   bit depth under some circumstances

v1.4.1 - May 9, 2004
 * Added 'maxb' (MAXimum Bytes) option to auto-set the
   output image quality (JPEG) or bit depth (PNG/GIF) so
   that the output thumbnail is less than 'maxb' bytes
   (thanks e_belleØhotmail*com)
 * Added 'bgt' parameter to make rounded corners from
   'brx'/'bry' option transparent when used with PNG
   output. Note: PHP/GD appears buggy at this time, so this
   option must force output to 256-color mode for this
   to work. The feature will be updated when a non-broken
   version of PHP/GD is released.
   (thanks javierØircorion*net)
 * Bugfix: Caching was broken
   (thanks mikeØgdaymate*nl, jurewiczØgo3*pl)

v1.4.0 - April 30, 2004
 * Rewritten as a PHP class. Split into several files:
   - phpthumb.class.php        = most processing code
   - phpthumb.functions.php    = support functions
   - phpthumb.readme.txt       = usage instructions
   - phpthumb.changelog.txt    = this file
   - phpthumb.config.php       = configuration file
   - phpthumb.gif.php          = Non-GD GIF reading support
   - phpthumb.unsharp.php      = Unsharp Masking support
   - phpThumb.php              = demo script that works
       exactly as previous versions; this is a drop-in
       replacement for existing phpThumb() installations
   - phpThumb.demo.showpic.php = demo script that auto-
       resizes a popup window to the size of the image
       shown. Useful if you want popup images but do not
       know the large image size beforehand
 * Added optional call-out to ImageMagick (if avaible) if
   source image is larger than PHP memory restrictions
   allow. ImageMagick installation should be auto-detected
   under *nix, but you should configure 'imagemagick_path'
   for use under Windows.
 * 'max_source_pixels' is now auto-calculated from PHP
   configuration settings. Due to various server-level
   restrictions that may override PHP settings this
   calculated value may not always be correct, and you may
   have to specify the value manually.
 * Added rounded-corner border option. You must specify
   both 'brx' (horizontal radius) and 'bry' (vertical
   radius) as well as 'bw' (border width). If 'bw' is
   greater than zero, the image will be shrunk to fit
   inside the border with a margin of background color.
   If 'bw' is zero, the corners of the image will be
   cut off and filled with background color.
   (thanks javierØircorion*net)
 * Minor speed improvement for unsharp masking

v1.3.7 - March 28, 2004
 * Bugfix: GD version detection was broken on PHP <4.3.0
   on servers where phpinfo() was disabled
   (thanks javierØircorion*net)
 * Bugfix: Non-GD GIF support was broken on restricted
   PHP configurations
   (thanks javierØircorion*net)
 * Bugfix: phpThumb.gif.php output error messages if PHP
   was running in Safe Mode
 * Added 'iar' parameter (Ignore Aspect Ratio) to allow
   non-proportional resizing (stretch image to fit).
   You must specify 'h' and 'w' to use this option.
   (thanks javierØircorion*net)

v1.3.6 - March 14, 2004
  * Bugfix: was broken when register_globals turned on
    (thanks joshgØtwcny*rr*com)
  * Bugfix: Images with transparent backgrounds now have
    the background color filled with the color specified
    by the 'bg' parameter
  * Bugfix: ImageCreateFromString() is broken in the
    non-bundled GD. Added workaround, but please use
    the bundled version of GD if possible
    (thanks dnØxbe*ch)
  * Bugfix: EXIF thumbnail caching was broken
  * Bugfix: EXIF thumbnail handling was broken for PHP
    v4.2.x
    (thanks smithk1Øshaw*ca)
  * Bugfix: Image borders with GD2 were misaligned
  * Bugfix: virtual paths/filenames like /~user/foo.jpg
    should now work properly, if PHP is installed as an
    Apache module (see www.php.net/apache-lookup-uri)
  * Bugfix: contents of any non-image file could be
    displayed (including PHP & HTML files)
    (thanks arsyanØarsyan*com)
  * Added rotation parameters 'ra' and 'ar'
    (thanks drØrhodes360*com)
  * Added $CONFIG['output_allow_enlarging'], defaulted
    to false, to prevent smaller-than-max-size images
    from being enlarged beyond their original size. If
    you want to be able to enlarge images, set this to
    false. Can be overridden with the 'aoe' parameter
    (thanks dnØxbe*ch)
  * Changed all configuration variables to be under one
    array named $CONFIG
  * Moved color and font options for ErrorImage() to
    $CONFIG variables
  * Changed cached filename structure (again) to a more
    flexible format that can handle future expansion
    (old cached files are invalid and will be recreated)
  * Added more debugging code to phpThumbDebug

v1.3.5 - February 29, 2004
  * Added capability to use EXIF thumbnail that may be
    embedded in source image (often is in digital camera
    JPEGs) and source image dimensions are larger than
    $config_max_source_pixels. This will overcome the
    limitation where PHP runs out of memory processing
    large images (usually >1600x1200). EXIF thumbnail
    extraction requires PHP v4.2.0 or higher and EXIF
    support compiled into PHP (or php_exif extension)
  * Eliminated intermediate read-file-to-memory stage if
    image is created from local file. Should allow
    larger images to be processed without running out of
    memory.
  * Added optional 'goto' parameter to be used with the
    'file' parameter, where 'goto' is a URL that is
    redirected to after image is rendered to file
    (thanks wimbleØwebdonors*com)
  * Added optional 'xto' parameter that will bypass all
    processing and just return the embedded EXIF
    thumbnail, if available.
  * Added error-handling if ImageTypes() is unavailable

v1.3.4 - February 15, 2004
  * Custom error image option (&err=img.jpg) which can
    also be set as $config_error_message_image_default
    (thanks carlØ4thstar*net)
  * &f=text will now output plain-text error messages
  * ErrorImage() now used for anti-hotlink messages (if
    $config_nohotlink_erase_image is true)

v1.3.3 - February 5, 2004
  * Bugfix: Added stripslashes() to filenames if
    magic_quotes_gpc is enabled
    (thanks arsyanØarsyan*com)
  * Output can now be rendered to a file only (not to
    browser) specified by the 'file' parameter
    (thanks arsyanØarsyan*com)
  * JPEG quality now has a maximum of 95%, as specified
    in the GD documentation

v1.3.2.1 - February 3, 2004
  * Bugfix: gd_version() was broken for GD v2.0+
  * Bugfix: removed debugging code

v1.3.2 - February 3, 2004
  * Bugfix: when borders are enabled, portait images
    with no width constraint, or landscape images with
    no height constraint were smaller than neccesary by
    double the border width
    (thanks jjjØxs4all*nl)
  * Added unsharp mask option thanks to Torstein Hønsi:
    http://www.vikjavev.com/hovudsida/umtestside.php
    Note: requires GD v2.x to function
    (thanks jjjØxs4all*nl)
  * Updated cache filenames to reflect new parameters,
    this means old cached files will need to be deleted
    (or not, they just will never get called again) and
    new cached versions will be created.
  * Added caching to gd_info() calls for minor speedup

v1.3.1 - February 2, 2004
  * Added optional border (width and color configurable)
    (thanks arsyanØarsyan*com)
  * Added option to create fixed-dimension thumbnails
    regardless of source aspect ration. Set the 'bw'
    (BorderWidth) parameter (even to 0) and this will be
    enabled. Outside the actual image will be filled
    with 'bg' color (default FFFFFF)
    (thanks arsyanØarsyan*com)

v1.3.0 - January 27, 2004
  * Added watermarking option to overlay thumbnails with
    a semi-transparent watermark image (copied from a
    seperate source watermark image)
    (thanks arsyanØarsyan*com)
  * Added option for absolute filenames (on both Windows
    and *nix) outside the DOCUMENT_ROOT directory
  * Added debug output dump for diagnosing problems)

v1.2.8 - January 19, 2004
  * added ability to specify relative pathnames as well
    as absolute pathnames (pathname is relative to the
    location of phpThumb.php if the passed source does
    not begin with "/"

v1.2.7 - January 7, 2004
  * Added patch to allow use of PHP older than 4.1.0
    (or GD without PNG support) for non-GD GIF support
    (thanks hostwebserverØhotmail*com)

v1.2.6 - January 4, 2004
  * Added patch to allow use of PHP older than 4.1.0
    (without the superglobals arrays)

v1.2.5 - December 26, 2003
  * Added configuration options for default output image
    format and max width/height

v1.2.4 - December 20, 2003
  * Bugfix: temp directory for non-native GD support not
    always returning valid directory
  * Caching feature reintroduced (see configuration)

v1.2.3 - December 19, 2003
  * Added anti-hotlink code so the thumbnail script on
    one domain cannot be used by another domain. The
    list of allowed domains defaults to the current
    domain but is configurable below as
    $config_nohotlink_valid_domains. The message, text
    size, colors and whether to blank the image or not
    are also configurable
  * Bugfix: URL image sources were not able to use the
    non-GD GIF-reading functions

v1.2.2 - December 17, 2003
  * Added option to use http:// URL as image source

v1.2.1 - December 11, 2003
  * Added option to get source data from a database
    rather than a physical file
  * Bugfix: resize not proportional when wide image
    limited more by max height than max width
    Thanks mathias_strasserØgmx*net
  * Removed caching code

v1.2.0 - December 10, 2003
  * Added GIF support for versions of GD that do not
    have built-in GIF support (v1.6.x) via the "GIF
    Util" class by Fabien Ezber (www.yamasoft.com)
    GD's built-in GIF-reading functions are faster, and
    are present in PHP v4.3.0 or newer, but all versions
    of GD can display resized GIF thumbnails now.

v1.1.2 - October 26, 2003
  * check for source image existance to prevent text
    error messages
  * if GD not available, a GIF saying "no GD" is shown
    instead of showing the original image
  * Cache feature introduced

v1.1.1 - September 28, 2003
  * better resize code by sfisher10Øcox*net

v1.1.0 - September 1, 2003
  * initial public release
  * thumbnails can now be larger than source image
  * graphical error messages

v1.0.0 - January 7, 2002
  * initial private release
