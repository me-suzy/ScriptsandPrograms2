Thank you for using PHPicture, created by Crashthatch.

Requirements:
PHP4 with the GD extension for manipulating images.
Some images in .jpg, .gif or .png format.

To begin using:
1) Delete the sample images in the "images" folder, and put some of your own in.
2) Upload everything to your webserver (usually by using FTP).
3) Point your browser to "http://www.yoursite.com/phpicture/install.php"
4) Keep clicking "continue" as neccessary.

It's now fully installed, and you can visit picture.php to start using the picture-displayer.
The images will be displayed in alphabetical order.

If you add new pictures, rename pictures, or the gallery page is not displaying the correct
thumbnails, you will need to refresh the thumbnails.
Do this by pointing your browser to the install.php file, which is in the same directory as the
picture.php and gallery.php files.

If you require further support, or have any questions/feedback/feature requests etc, visit the
website, the forums (URLs below) or email me at the address shown below.
