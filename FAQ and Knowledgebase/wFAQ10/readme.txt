wFAQ v1.0 - Created by the Webligo Group, DBA Webligo Developments.
http://www.webligo.com/



>> SUMMARY

We created wFAQ to give you a way to quickly and easily create
a customizable FAQ page on your website without any required coding.
If you are ready to begin, please review the installation instructions 
outlined below.



>> SERVER REQUIREMENTS

1. You must have PHP v4.2.0 or newer installed.
2. You must have an available MySQL database.

Note: Not all servers are configured the same way. If you have an extremely
non-standard configuration, like any PHP script, this may not run correctly.



>> INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Upload all of the files in this zip except for readme.txt to your
web server in the folder where you want to install your FAQ.
You should upload all PHP files in ASCII mode, and the /images/ folder in 
BINARY mode. To upload these files, you will need an FTP client such as
Ipswitch WS_FTP (http://www.ipswitch.com).

2. Set full permissions (CHMOD 777) on faq_config.php. NOTE: To set 
permissions in WS_FTP, right click on the file and select "chmod". Then 
click all the boxes to CHMOD 777.

3. Open your browser, and go to the URL where you have placed "faq_install.php",
for example: http://www.yoursite.com/faq_install.php

4. A page with further instructions should open. Follow these instructions to
complete your installation.



>> OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION

1. After you have logged in to your admin panel, you can modify your HTML header
and footer to give your FAQ page the same look and feel of the rest of your
website. Simply cut and paste whatever HTML you want above your FAQ content into
the HTML header field, and whatever HTML you want below your FAQ content into
the HTML footer field.
