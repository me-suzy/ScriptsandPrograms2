	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Leads4web is a webbased CRM-Application.</b><br><br>
	CRM means Customer Relationship Management and stands for the management of customer related information of all kind. 
	<br><br>
	With leads4web/3 you can manage your contact data <b>within a team</b>. 
	Everyone within the team has certain rights and belongs to one or maybe more groups. 
	So you can have a group "admin", a group "sales", whatever you want. 
	<br><br>
	The admin decides about permissions and the general structure of the groups, depending on what suits your company. 
	<br>
	Leads4web/3 is not a simple contact information management -
	it is a very flexible tool when it comes to organize information for more than one user. 
	<br><br>
	Have a look and find out more about leads4web/3. We suggest the following entry points
	for reading:

		Click on "User management" in the Configuration menu and wait a second (or two ;) for the applet to be loaded. What you will see is something like the lefthand picture. 
 	<br><br>
		Moving your mouse over the default group "websphere" will result in a popup window having a link which lets you add a new user to that group. 
	 <br><br>	
		Click on that link and fill out the form in the new window. If you don't want the user to become Admin of that group as well, uncheck the appropriate box. 
	 <br><br>	
		Click on "the user has been added" to close the window and wait for the results in the main window: You should see the new user (and you can login now as the new user with the password you've just given). 
	 <br><br>	
		We'll try that in the next step of this quick tour.

		What you will see now is just two contacts! This is because you are logged in as admin, and the third contact created by the other user before was private. So what you see is a contact you can change ("first contact") and another one you are only allowed to read ("second contact").

<a name="users_and_groups"><h2>Users and Groups:</h2></a><a href='#contents'>[top]</a>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Every user has (exactly) one default group.</b></li>
  <li><b>Every user is member of zero or more groups.</b></li>
  <li><b>Every user is admin of zero or more groups. If the user is admin of a
      certain group, he has to be member of that group as well.</b></li>
  <li><b>Some users can have a special status, they are <i>superadmins</i>. If you
      are superadmin, you can do (nearly) everything.</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<table width='90%' align='center'>
<tr>
	<td>
	In order to organize your staff or manage the employees of your organisation,
	you have to <b>create different groups</b> (you might think of <i>roles</i> as well). 
	There might be a group called 'CEOs', 'human resources', 'secretary' or anything 
	else.
	<br><br>
	<b>Every single contact or any other piece of shared information will be assigned to a
	certain group, and members of this group can access this information.</b> 
	<br><br>
	The more groups you are member of, the more information you have access to. In a 
	hierachically organized company, the boss will be member of all groups, and other
	employees might be member of a single group only - maybe the only member of this group.
	<br><br>
	<u><b>The default group</b></u>:
	<br><br>
	Every user has a default group assigned to him or her. This default group is used whenever
	leads4web has to decide which group to use if there is no additional information.
	<br><br>
	<u><b>Being admin of a group</b></u>:
	<br><br>
	If a user is admin of a group, he has additional rights concerning this group. (...)
	<br><br>
	<u><b>Being member of no group at all</b></u>:
	<br><br>
	If a user does not belong to any group, he cannot access the system any more.

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<table width='90%' align='center'>
<tr>
	<td>
	
	
	<u><b>A single user</b></u>:
	<br><br>
	Not a very interesting case. Leads4web/3 is to manage shared information about contacts, 
	companies, follow-ups and so on. So there should be more than one user. Sure, you
	can use a single-user installation; but this chapter might not be of any use to you.
	<br><br>
	<u><b>A small company</b></u>:
	<br><br>
	Suppose there is a company with, say, 5 leads4web users, 2 of which are chiefs, and
	3 sales forces.
	<br><br>
	Use "Configuration -> User Management" or "Configuration -> User Management II" if you
	want to create those users:
	<br><br>
	<img src='img/users_and_groups_example_1.jpg'>
	<br><br>
	As you can see, Chief1 and Chief2 both are members of the group "small company" as well
	as of the group "Sales"; therefore they have access to any information of those groups.
	The three salesman on the other hand have access to the information defined within group
	"sales".
	<br><br>
	If you don't want the salesman to share their information, you have to add additional
	groups:
	<br><br>
	<img src='img/users_and_groups_example_2.jpg'>
	<br><br>
	It's getting a bit complex, isn't it?
	<br><br>
	Salesman3, for example, is member of group GR Salesman 3, and of no other group, whereas
	chief1 is member of all groups. So chief1 can see anything Salesman3 can see, but not the
	other way round - Salesman3 can access only the information of his own sinlge group, GR Salesman 3.
	<br><br>
	This kind of visualisation gets very complex once you have defined a number of groups,
	so we suggest using the "Configuration -> User Management II" view:
	<br><br>
	<img src='img/users_and_groups_example_3.jpg'>
	<br><br>
	You define a group as a "starting point" (in this case: "small company"), and you
	see all members of this group in the next level (Chief1 and Chief2). Opening the
	entry for Chief1 yields to the collection of groups this user is member of - with
	one exception: As you can see in the first level, Chief1 <i>is</i> member of the
	group "small company" - this membership will not be repeated in the next level, as
	the tree would get much to complex this way.
