This is a PHP Censor written by Garrett P. It's simply a PHP function that takes one paramater, $content. $content is what you would like to be censored. It will return the censored content. Make a file called censorwords.txt, and place each word you would like censored on a new line. Make sure there are no blank lines, they tend to magically appear at the end of some files.

Happy censoring!
