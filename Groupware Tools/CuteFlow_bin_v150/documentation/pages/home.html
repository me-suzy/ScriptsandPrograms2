	<h2>What is CuteFlow</h2>
	CuteFlow is a webbased document circulation tool. Users are able to define "documents" which are send step by step to every station/user in a list.<br>
	It's an electronical way for doing (i.e. internal) document circulations.<br>
	A document can be assembled from input fields that could be filled by the receiver of the document. So after a completed circulation you will have
	a completely filled document. Also Attachments to the document are possible (i.e. for illustration material).<br>
