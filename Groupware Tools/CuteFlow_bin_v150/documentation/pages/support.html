	<h1>Support</h1>
	<h2>Free support</h2>
	You can get free support on the Cuteflow Sourceforge project page (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cuteflow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cuteflow</a>). There are public forums and mailing lists. If you found bugs, you can post them there (BugTracker)
	<h2>Professional support</h2>
	If you need professional support (maybe for installation, initial setup of document templates or customized features that are not included in CuteFlow) you can contact the EMEDIA OFFICE GmbH, a company located in Germany (Mail: <a href="mailto:cuteflow@emedia-office.de">cuteflow@emedia-office.de</a>, <a href="http://www.emedia-office.de">http://www.emedia-office.de</a>). <br>

	<strong>Please note that this professional support is NOT FREE!</strong>
