<h3>PHProjekt Installation - F A Q</h3>

<table>
<td width=580 id=normal>

<ul>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<li><a href="#55">I have a question about PHP!</a>

<li><a href="#30">Where can I find tutorials about installing a LAMP or WAMP system?</a>
<li><a href="#13">Does PHProjekt work with PHP3?</a>
<li><a href="#3">I have downloaded the zip file and extracted but where is this config file?</a>
<li><a href="#74">Which file and folder attributes (or:permissions) does the webserver need?</a>
<li><a href="#77">I saw several bugfixes available for the current version - do I need to download them, too?</a>
<li><a href="#91">Do I have to setup the required tables in the database before the installation?</a>

<h4>The environment test</h4>
<li><a href="#94">Trying the database conncetion test in the test routine gives me a blank page! Any clues?</a>

<h4>The setup routine</h4>
<li><a href="#54">When I click on setup.php, my apache crashes with an error like:</a>
<li><a href="#4">After choosing the setup type (installation), language and db
          type on the first screen, I don't see any words on the next screen!</a>
<li><a href="#16">Setup will always show me the first screen, I can't continue!</a>
<li><a href="#21">During the installation the following error messages appear:<br>
          user@linux:~/phprojekt-2.4 > setup.php ...</a>
<li><a href="#35">I get the following errors after selecting modules: An error ocurred while creating table: 'dateien'</a>
<li><a href="#42">I try to setup the whole stuff, but I always get blank pages. What can I do?</a>

<li><a href="#47">When I call setup.php from a browser I get "Document contains no data" in Netscape and a blank screen in IE</a>
<li><a href="#54">When I click on setup.php, my apache crashes with an error like: <br>
          The instruction at "xxxkjk" referenced memory at "0xxx". The memory could not be read.</a>
<li><a href="#52"> After the installation failed and tried to install PHProjekt once again but it asks me for an admin
          and password now!</a>
<li><a href="#59">I get this error when i try to run setup.php Warning: Failed opening \'/usr/www/webroot/go.geno.com/html/index.php\' for
inclusion (include_path=\'.:/usr/local/lib/php\') in Unknown on line 0</a>
<li><a href="#61">I'm having a little trouble setting it up: "Database connection failed! Call admin, please"</a>
<li><a href="#80">I get the message: "Oops - can't find my session". What do I have to do?</a>
<li><a href="#85">Running the file setup.php gives me this message: "Oops! Can't include or find the language files in the directory 'lang'! ..."
                  But the file IS in it's right place! what can I do?</a>

<h4>After the setup</h4>
<li><a href="#6">The setup is done but it tells me that it still misses the file config.inc.php</a></a>
<li><a href="#12">After the login screen I get several screens, each with the login dialog :-(<br>
              (Problem also known as 'four login screens')</a>
<li><a href="#14">Warning: crypt() is not supported in this PHP build in lib.inc.php on line 174</a>
<li><a href="#28">After running the setup.php from the terminal line, I get errors like: "Unexpected token on line 6" ... etc.</a>
<li><a href="#46">when I call the setup.php file from a browser I get the following error message:<br>
          Warning: Failed opening \'/usr/local/hec/setup.php\' for inclusion (include_path=\'.:/usr/share/php\') in Unknown on line 0</a>

<li><a href="#53">I installed PHProjekt but when I call the index.php, the following error message appears:<br>
          "Warning: open_basdir restriction in effect. File is in wrong directory...</a>
<li><a href="#48">Everything is working except if you put a single quote in any of the fields I get an unclosed quotation mark before the character string ')'. error.</a>
<li><a href="#67">Running index.php I get the following: "Warning: stat failed for ../../../config.inc.php (errno=2 - No ..." what happens here?</a>
<li><a href="#75">Is there somewhere I can download a config.inc.php? I still haven't successfully created one due to some weird error. </a>

<h4>File manager</h4>
<li><a href="#19">I cannot up- and download files! The system tells me:<br>
          SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The script whose uid is 911 is not allowed
          to access /var/tmp/gfd8sa owned by uid 3 in /www/htdocs/phprojekt/dateien.inc.php
          on line 25</a>

<li><a href="#31">When I try to upload a file, I get an error: "Oops! Something went wrong ...</a>
<li><a href="#32">The file module doesn't work at all!</a>
<li><a href="#37">I'm trying to configure the file system of PHProjekt. The mysql server and the server with the PHProjekt files on it aren't the same.</a>
<li><a href="#39">Upload works perfect using Files smaller than aprox. 2MB. Using bigger files leads to an error message.</a>
<li><a href="#51">Since I activated SSL, I cannot download files from the filemanager!</a>
<li><a href="#49">How can I upload different files with the same name in multiple directories?</a>
<li><a href="#66">Is it possible to change the max_filesize given in the upload form?</a>
<li><a href="#68">Though the uploaded files are in the upload directory, I still cannot download them!</a>
<li><a href="#69">Running PHProjekt with SSL I cannot download any file!</a>

<li><a href="#78">I installed PHProjekt on an e-smith, but the file upload doesn't seem to work.</a>
<li><a href="#79">Download of a file results in a 0 byte file! In the upload dir the filesize is ok.</a>
<li><a href="#88">After the upload, the uploaded file exists in /tmp but the copy routine fails!</a>
<li><a href="#89">I have problems opening and saving pdf files!</a>
<li><a href="#98">I updated my webserver to apache 2.x and suddenly uploads beyond 500kB are denied! What happened?</a> 
<li><a href="#100">Though I'm sure the pathes in the config.inc.php are set properly I still get the message
                   at the download: "panic! specified file not found ..." - what could be the reason?</a> 

<h4> Mail client</h4>
<li><a href="#8">I want to use the full mail client, but I cannot find him!</a>

<li><a href="#33">I sent a mail via the mail module and I didn't get any error, but the recipient never received any mail. What happened?</a>
<li><a href="#38">I have a WAMP configuration (with windows). How can I activate the mail module?</a>
<li><a href="#44">I have a problem with email-Client and the file download. When I get an email with an attachment,<br>
              I get a white screen when I try to open the attachment.</a>
<li><a href="#45">I make my installation without any problem but in the mail module all I get is a simple form to send a mail. What's wrong...?</a>
<li><a href="#50">In the Online Demo i see a frame with folders, the possibility of new folders and so on.<br>
          In my PHProjekt installation I see only the window for new Mails. Why?</a>
<li><a href="#56">Is there a module that will allow receiving mail on standard POP (non-IMAP) servers?</a>

<li><a href="#63">I only can send small attachments (e.g. smaller 1MB). How can I change this?</a>
<li><a href="#70">The eMail client of phprojekt has no feature to store which eMails are already loaded.<br>
                  So everytime you ask for new Mails, the client gets all Mails on the POP Server.</a>
<li><a href="#72">I don't see any body from a mail</a>
<li><a href="#73">I changed the value of $quickmail in the config from 1 to 2 in order to receive mails as well,
                  but I get a sql error message saying that some tables do not exist. What happened?</a>
<li><a href="#81">Is it possible to send mail from a windows system without an own mailserver?</a>
<li><a href="#97">Each time I fetch mails I get lots of php source code on the screen. How can I get rid of it?</a>

<li><a href="#92">During the setup I get this: "Session error! Please set the correct temp path in 
                  the variable session.save_path at php.ini" But there is a value in the php.ini!</a>

<li><a href="#29">After I run setup I get the next page with "Seems that You have a valid database connection!"<br>
          but after I submit I get errors, can't create table.</a>

<li><a href="#34">Do I really need an empty database to install phprojekt. Can't i use an existing one.</a>

<b>Q:</b> The system seems to hang but no error message appears!<br>
<b>A:</b> Uncomment the line error_reporting(0); in the index.php and lib.inc.php, you may get several warnings
          or error messages. Please post the message in the forum on the homepage.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=2></a>

<b>Q:</b> Everything went perfect but I can't log in with root/root.<br>
          Or: I created a new user but I cannot login with his combination!<br>
<b>A:</b> Look into the config: if the variable $login_kurz<br>
          =0, use the last name (field 'nachname' in the database)<br>
          =1 use the short name (kurz)<br>

          =2 use the login name (loginname)<br>
          together with the password should work.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=3></a>
<b>Q:</b> I have downloaded the zip file and extracted but where is this config file?<br>
<b>A:</b> Did you already run setup.php? This will install PHProjekt on your system and write the configuration file.<br>

          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=4></a>
<b>Q:</b> After choosing the setup type (installation), language and db
          type on the first screen, I don't see any words on the next screen!<br>
<b>A:</b> This behaviour could have vaious reasons:<br>
          - the script tries to connect at this moment to the database - but if the db support misses, the script crashes<br>
          - The script fails to include the file for the chosen language.<br>

          Extend the include paths for the variable 'include_path' in the php.ini.<br>
          (or leave the value blank)<br>
          Another hint from a user: the variable magic_quotes_gpc in the php.ini must be set to 'on'<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=5></a>
<b>Q:</b> The setup is done but it tells me that it still misses the file config.inc.php<br>

<b>A:</b> The webserver did not have the right to write this file at the end of the setup routine.
          chmod 777 for the directory, delete all tables and try again.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=6></a>
<b>Q:</b> I want to use the ldap access. What do I have to do?<br>
<b>A:</b> First of all you have to have the ldap extensions of PHP activated.
          Then the checkbox in the setup appears. After this you have to:<br>

          - Activate LDAP by setting the LDAP-field in setup.php to 1.<br>
          - Edit ldapconf.php according to your needs.<br>
          (You can create as many ldap-configurations as you want to, you just have
          to copy the configuration array and increase its index number by one -e.g. change the index to '2' for the 2nd configuration).<br>
          -Create your new users by choosing 'create user' in the admin module.<br>
          You have to select one LDAP-configuration and to enter user-data that
          can't be retrieved via LDAP. The loginname has to be equivalent to the LDAP UID<br>
          (you can change this in ldapconf.php by changing the 'uid'-field to the field you want to, but this has not been tested).<br>

<b>Q:</b> Warning: OCIStmtExecute: ORA-00910: specified length too long for its datatype in lib.inc.php on line 95<br>
<b>A:</b> PHProjekt does not support oracle version 7 or lower.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=8></a>
<b>Q:</b> I want to use the full mail client, but I cannot find him!<br>
<b>A:</b> You have to have the imap extensions of php activated. Then you get the option to choose the installation
          of the full mail client in the setup.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=9></a>
<b>Q:</b> How can I include own modules?<br>

<b>A:</b> This is quite easy: take the folder with all files (including an 'index.php') and place it into the folder 'addons' in the PHProjekt
          root directory. The name of your folder will appear in the navigation bar.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<b>Q:</b> Warning: MySQL Connection Failed: Can't connect to MySQL server on '10.100.1.4' (111) in
          /www/htdocs/phprojekt/setup.php on line 117<br>
<b>A:</b> Your webserver can't establish a connection to the mysql database<br>

          Reasons: the database or the connection to it is down or broken, or you
          have the wrong parameters.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=11></a>
<b>Q:</b> Fatal error: Call to undefined function: ocilogon() in /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/phprojekt/setup.php on line 119<br>
<b>A:</b> Your current PHP does not support oracle. Solution: Linux: compile your PHP --with-oci8,
          Windows: get php_oci8.dll - and don't forget to uncomment the respective line in the php.ini<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=12></a>
<b>Q:</b> After the login screen I get several screens, each with the login dialog :-(<br>
          (also named: 'four login screens')<br>
<b>A:</b> Reason: The browser looses his session and therefore the server can't remember that you already logged in:<br>
          - Because of security reasons You have to enable cookies.<br>
          - Your php version is 4.0.0 or lower - the session maangement doesn't work properly here.<br>

          - The session are not properly stored on the server. (make sure that a session.save_path in the php.ini
            is defined and the webserver has read and write permissions for this folder)<br>
          An user reported this solution here: "set in the php.ini 'session.use_cookies' to 'On' and
          'session.auto_start' to 'Off', viceversa you get stuck!"<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<b>Q:</b> Does PHProjekt work with PHP3?<br>
<b>A:</b> No way, sorry :-(<br>

<a name=14></a>
<b>Q:</b> Warning: crypt() is not supported in this PHP build in lib.inc.php on line 174 <br>
<b>A:</b> You have a windows PHP version which does not support the command crypt.<br>
           -> take any other PHP version than 4.0.5<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=15></a>
<b>Q:</b> Warning: Wrong parameter count for session_register() in lib.inc.php on line 114<br>
<b>A:</b> That's a bug in early PHP4 versions. -> use a PHP4 version 4.0.2 or higher<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=16></a>
<b>Q:</b> Setup will always show me the first screen, I can't continue!<br>

<b>A:</b> Have a look into the php.ini: the variable 'allow_call_time_pass_reference' must be set to 'on'.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=17></a>
<b>Q:</b> I have installed PHProjekt, but how do I get the languages set?<br>
<b>A:</b> Go to the admin page to the 'modify user' screen: you can choose the language in the last select box.<br>

<b>Q:</b> Warning: open(/tmp\sess_8e3f13497b89881b4f71e6beecadd6d3, O_RDWR) failed: m (2) in c:/phproject/admin.php on line 1<br>
<b>A:</b> The path where your sessions are stored is not set properly. Edit the variable session.save_path in the php.ini<br>

<b>Q:</b> I cannot up- and download files! The system tells me:<br>
          SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The script whose uid is 911 is not allowed
          to access /var/tmp/gfd8sa owned by uid 3 in /www/htdocs/phprojekt/dateien.inc.php
          on line 25<br>
<b>A:</b> Your system does not allow that the webserver copies files from
          the tmp directory to the file directory specified in the config. -> ask
          your provider to turn off the safe_mode.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=20></a>

<b>Q:</b> My chat doesn't work!<br>
<b>A:</b> The reason could be that your webserver does not have the privilege to write files in this folder.<br>
          Try 'chmod -R 777 'your phprojekt directory' - means, the webserver must have read and write privileges
          for the /chat directory.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=21></a>
<b>Q:</b> During the installation the following error messages appear:<br>

          user@linux:~/phprojekt-2.4 > setup.php<br>
          ./setup.php: ?: File or list not found<br>
          ./setup.php: //##: File or list not found<br>
          ./setup.php: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token <br>
<b>A:</b> Since PHProjekt is a PHP4 tool, it does not work from the command line.<br>
          The system requirements are a webserver with a php parser and a sql database.<br>

          Then You have to extract the files into a directory of your webserver and call the script setup.php via your browser.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=22></a>
<b>Q:</b> What should I prepare for an installation with postgres?<br>
<b>A:</b> 1. create a database: createdb phprojekt This must be done as user postgres (su - postgres)<br>
          If this fails, it's very likely that postgres is not running properly.
          (/etc/rc.d/postgres restart for postgres restart)<br>

          2. create a user who also has a UNIX account, he must be identical with
          the webserver (often wwwrun or nobody) - createuser wwwrun<br>
          Give him the privilege to create tables<br>
          3. now insert the fields below with db_name = phprojekt and db_user wwwrun, mostly no password required.<br>

<a name=23></a>
<b>Q:</b> I tried an installation with postegres keeping in mind the above  hints and it still doesn't work!<br>

<b>A:</b> A user reported that in his case the postgres installation itself was bad!
          After fixing this everything worked out fine ...<br>

<b>Q:</b> I'm trying to install PHProjekt with Postgres 7.1.2.<br>
          But I get this message: "Fatal error: call to undefined function pg_connect ..." <br>
<b>A:</b> You forgot to compile PHP with postgres support!<br>

<b>Q:</b> Do you have any hints for the installation with oracle?<br>
<b>A:</b> First the compiling:<br>
          cd apache<br>
          ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a<br>

          cd ../php<br>
          $ ./configure --with-apache=../apache --with-oci8=$ORACLE_HOME --enable-sigchild<br>
          make make install<br>
          cd ../apache # need to do it again..<br>
          ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a<br>
          make<br>

          make install<br>
          Second the configuring:<br>
          Set the following variables before you start your Apache (Useful to insert
          the into the /etc/init.d/httpd script or /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl:)<br>
          ORACLE_HOME=/opt/orabin/oracle/OraHome1<br>
          NLS_LANG=HUNGARIAN_HUNGARY.EE8MSWIN1250 <- replace your country's settings!<br>
          ORACLE_SID=ORACLE<br>

          export ORACLE_HOME NLS_LANG ORACLE_SID<br>
          With these settings phprojekt should work on Oracle 8.x or higher.<br>
          An admin reported that he got problems with long trigger names, resulting in an error
          for the auto_increment function. he recommend to shorten the trigger names to e.g. *auto_inc<br>

<b>Q:</b> I have a MySQL-DB on my providers host which already has a table named users.<br>

          Is it possible to rename PHProjekt's table users to something else? <br>
<b>A:</b> There is an article on the hoempage about a patch named 'prefix' which you can use.<br>

<b>Q:</b> I am running suse 7.0, with apache and mod_php4, with mysql.<br>
          I created the blank database, got the permissions right, and ran setup.php.<br>

          I chose installation, and entered all my info, and what i got back was:<br>
          <i>Sorry, it did not work!<br>
          Please fix it and restart the installation.</i> <br>
<b>A:</b> This message wants to tell you that your parameters are not set properly.<br>
          This could have several reasons
          Typical db access parameters are:<br>

          host: localhost<br>
          user: root<br>
          password: [no password]<br>
          database: [name of new blank db]<br>

<a name=28></a>

<b>Q:</b> After running the setup.php from the terminal line, I get errors like:<br>
          "Unexpected token on line 6" ... etc.<br>
<b>A:</b> You need to have a working LAMP (or similar) configuration.<br>
          Place PHProjekt in a subdirectory of your e.g.htdocs dir<br>
          Then call the 'localhost' in your browser, search the PHProjekt dir and run setup.php<br>

          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=29></a>
<b>Q:</b> After I run setup I get the next page with "Seems that You have a valid database connection!"<br>
          but after I submit I get errors, can't create table.<br>
<b>A:</b> sorry but this check with the following message just covers a part of the conncetion test.<br>
          So it seems that it still cannot write the tables.<br>

          1. because no new database exists.<br>
          2. the webserver is not allowed to write tables into the db <br>
          3. the connection parameters are still not correct.<br>

<b>Q:</b> When I try to upload a file, I get an error:<br>
          "Oops! Something went wrong ...<br>

          Please check whether the file exists in the target directory and the variable
          dat_rel in the config has the correct value<br>
<b>A:</b> Please check whether this directory exists and make sure the
          webserver is allowed to copy the files from the tmp directory to this directory.<br>
          (e.g. the variable 'file_uploads' in the php.ini must be set to on and the
          variable upload_tmp_dir has to point to a directory where the webserver has write access))<br>
          Typical values for the variables $dateien and $dat_rel are:<br>
          $dateien = "/usr/local/httpd/phprojekt/file"; and $dat_rel = "file"; for Linux or <br>
          $dateien = "c:\htdocs/phprojekt/file"; and $dat_rel = "file"; for windows<br>

          Also make sure that the value of upload_tmp_dir in the php.ini points to an existing path
          where the webserver has read and write permission.<br>
          Some users reported that the donwload only worked after they changed the
          path in the variable $dat_rel from relative to absolute.<br>
          Another reaons could be that in the php.ini the value for 'file upload' is not set to 'on'.
          In this case change the value to 'on' :)

<b>Q:</b> The file module doesn't work at all!<br>
          None of the mentioned hints helps ...<br>

<b>A:</b> Two users reported that they got the file module working after they updated to PHP 4.0.4 or higher.<br>
          Another user changed the copy function<br>
          copy($userfile, "$dateien/$filenewname");<br>
          with the function move_uploaded_file($userfile, "$dateien/$filenewname");<br>
          Maybe this does the trick. <br><br />
          Another user reported that he had to empty the value of 'open_basedir' in the php.ini to get the filemanager work.<br>

<a name=33></a>
<b>Q:</b> I sent a mail via the mail module and I didn't get any error,<br>
          but the recipient never received any mail. What happened?<br>
<b>A:</b> PHProjekt uses the built-in mail() function of PHP which accesses the mailserver of your system <br>
          (for Linux e.g. sendmail). Maybe this connection doesn't work.<br>

          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=34></a>
<b>Q:</b> Do I really need an empty database to install phprojekt. Can't i use an existing one.<br>
          The tables don't interfere!<br>
<b>A:</b> If you are sure that the tables which will be written do not have the same name as the
          existing tables, then you can use your existing database.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<b>Q:</b> I get the following errors after selecting modules:<br>
          An error ocurred while creating table: 'dateien'<br>
          ...<br>
          An error ocurred while creating table: 'termine'<br>
<b>A:</b> 1. You forgot to create a new, blank database<br>

          2. Your connection parameters do not work properly.<br>
          3. Your webserver does not have the right to create the tables<br>
          4. your database is not up and running<br>
          5. your RDBM (database system) is not compiled properly<br>

<b>Q:</b> I'm trying to configure the file system of PHProjekt.<br>

          The mysql server and the server with the PHProjekt files on it aren't the same.<br>
          Hence I can't configure the $dateien variable to correctly point to the file directory. <br>
<b>A:</b> Right, this works only with relative local pathes, not with remote access.<br>
          <a href=#top>up</a><br><br>

<a name=38></a>
<b>Q:</b> I have a WAMP configuration (with windows). How can I activate the mail module?<br>

<b>A:</b> For windows you need a smtp server (e.g. hamster) to get the mail function of PHP running.<br>
          Other hint from an user: insert the mailbox account of your provider in the SMTP variable in the
          php.ini and your email adress in the line below.<br>

<b>Q:</b> Upload works perfect using Files smaller than aprox. 2MB. Using bigger files leads to an error message.<br>
<b>A:</b> Raise the value of 'upload_max_filesize' and 'post_max_size' in the php.ini to the desired maximum upload size.<br>

          If it still doesn't work, ask your system administrator whether he limited the size for file transfer<br>

<b>Q:</b> The installation on my oracle failed! the tables have been created but no default user<br>

<b>Q:</b> [From the forum]Well there are a couple of days I try to setup the whole stuff,
          I am fed up with the same blank pages. What can I do?<br>

<b>A:</b> I had a similar experience where I was able to use a new install
          of php4 and mysql to run other php scripts including Phpmyadmin, but Phprojekt
          would not establish a mysql connection. I got a lot of blank pages! The
          problem was solved by issuing a command in mysql granting global privileges to root: GRANT ALL ON *.* TO root;<br>
          It was weird because I was already able to access all the databases as root and also as another user without any password. <br>

<b>Q:</b> There is a problem at the installation on an oracle db: none

<b>Q:</b> I have a problem with email-Client and the file download. When I get an email with an attachment, <br>
          I get a white screen when I try to open the attachment.<br>
<b>A:</b> I had a similar problem with email attachments - the mail would appear with the name of the attachment , but clicking on the attachment
          produced an error along the lines of \' panic - file not found \' or something like that.<br>
          The problem was resolved by changing permissions on the attachment directory
          (under the phprojekt directory) to give read/write access by the webserver
          - in my case this is the user \'nobody\', group \'nogroup\'.<br>

<b>Q:</b> The chat don´t send msg in the installed Version on my machine? any idea?<br>
<b>A:</b> The webserver (UID \'httpd\' or \'nobody\' or so) needs to have
          write permissions for the file \'chat.txt\'. <br>

<b>Q:</b> I make my installation without any problem. but when I use the
          demo version available on the web page, mail module has a lot of customization
          like write, read, leave on server, folders, etc., just like a complete web mail package.<br>
          In my installation in the mail module all I get is a simple form to send inmediate mail. What's wrong...?<br>
<b>A:</b> In order to run the full mail client, your php must have the imap extension of php active.<br>
          Your php does not have this library included, so the setup routine offered you only the module to send mails :-(<br>

<b>Q:</b> when I call the setup.php file from a browser I get the following error message:<br>

          what is wrong, what can I do?<br>
<b>A:</b> The script is not allowed to include any files. This is essential to the function of PHProjekt<br>
          -> Have a lookinto the php.ini weather the safe_mode is turned on or the variable include_path has a specific value (should be empty)<br>

<b>A:</b> A hint from an user: "I had \"session.save_handler = user\" in my php.ini so that the webserver could run apache.
          Commenting that out and setup ran through correctly."<br>

<b>Q:</b> In the Online Demo i see a frame with folders, the possibility of new folders and so on.<br>

          In my PHProjekt installation I see only the window for new Mails. Why?<br>
<b>A:</b> Your php does not have the imap extension, that's why the setup didn't offer you this option.<br>
          Required steps:<br>
          1. Activate the imap extension in your php (php_imap.dll) and check it via the phpinfo() function
          (One section in the output must deal with the imap extension)<br>
          2. set $quickmail = 1 in the config.inc.php<br>
          3. run setup/configure and set in the mail option a '2' - the system will install the required db tables.<br>

          4. create a mail account and test the full mail client<br>

<b>Q:</b> Since I activated SSL, I cannot download files from the filemanager!<br>
<b>A:</b> [From, the forum]: you can solve the problem by editing three PHProjekt(3.2) files:<br>
          filemanager_down.php, in the section "//set headers ..." uncomment the two lines containing "no-cache" and add the following line:<br>

          // header ("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");<br>
          // header ("Pragma: no-cache");<br>
          header ("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0,pre-check=0");
          header ("Pragma: public")<br><br>

          vcard_ex.php should look like this:<br>
          session_start(); // remove the # in the original file<br>
          header("Content-type: text");<br>

          header("Content-disposition: inline; filename=$name.vcf");<br>
          header ("Pragma: private"); //add this line<br>
          csv_ex.php add the "private" line to the header section:<br>
          header("Content-type: text/csv");<br>
          header("Content-disposition: inline; filename=$file.csv");<br>
          header ("Pragma: private"); //add this line<br>

<b>Q:</b> After the installation failed and tried to isntall PHProjekt once again but it asks me for an admin
          and password now!<br>
<b>A:</b> Seems that a config.inc.php is already on your system - the script assumes that you want to update or
          anything else and asks for your permission :-)<br>
          -> delete the config.inc.php and try it again.<br>

<b>Q:</b> I installed PHProjekt but when I call the index.php, the following error message appears:<br>
          "Warning: open_basdir restriction in effect. File is in wrong directory..."<br>
<b>A:</b> This is a security measure of PHP to prevent that any file from a directory which is not listed
          in the open_basedir parameter in the php.ini can be included.<br>
          Solution: Delete the value of the parameter open_basedir in the php.ini<br>

<b>Q:</b> Is there a module that will allow receiving mail on standard POP (non-IMAP) servers?

          Postgres requires in case of "localhost" the host simply unmentioned in the connect-string.<br><br>
          another hint from an user:<br>
         Basically you must not enter a hostname if the database is on localhost. Seems to be a bug in php.<br>
         After I tried that I was prompted with a javascript error, which told me I had to enter a hostname
         so I opened the file lib/chkform.js and commented out the complete body of the function chkForm and
         added the line "return true;" Now I was able to install phprojekt. <br>

<b>Q:</b> The eMail client of phprojekt has no feature to store which eMails are already loaded.<br>
          So everytime you ask for new Mails, the client gets all Mails on the POP Server.</a><br>
<b>A:</b> Be aware that there are two links in the navigation bar. One link is called 'receive ...:
          and the button next to ot '... and leave on the server'. To delete mails which are already

<b>Q:</b> I changed the value of $quickmail in the config from 1 to 2 in order to receive mails as well,
          but I get a sql error message saying that some tables do not exist. What happened?<br>
<b>A:</b> chnaging this calue is not enough, some database tables have to be created as well!
          <br />-> change the value back to 1 and run setup.php with the configure option.
          If the remark next to the mail module shows you a '2' to insert, then you are able
          to isntall the full mail client, otherwise your provider has to add the imap library
          to his php installation.<br>

<b>Q:</b> Which file and folder attributes (or: permissions) does the webserver need?<br>
<b>A:</b> <The webserver needs read permissions for all directories inside the PHProjekt root and
          write permissions to the follwing:><br />
          - a file named config.inc.php which will be written during the setup on the PHProjekt root level<br />

<b>Q:</b> The FAQ often refers to a 'php.ini', but I don't have access to this file<br>

<b>A:</b> Write a script with the following line:<br>
          phpinfo();<br>
          and check the output of this script - it lists you all values of the php.ini<br>

<b>Q:</b>I want to upgrade to Version 4.0 from 3.2 but I seem to have forgotten the root password. 
         Is there a known way to recover this? Can I just go into the users table and delete the 
         password entry for the root account?<br>
<b>A:</b>if you disabled the password encryption - yes ($pw_crypt = 0; in the config.inc.php)<br>
         In the case that the password encryption is enabled: Copy another known password in the database (table users,
         field pw) into the root record and then login with this password.<br><br>

<b>Q:</b>While starting an update I get the infamous "PANIC! config.inc.php can't be written! ..."
         Changed the folder permission to 777. Nothing. What happened?<br>

<b>A:</b>Changing the folder permission is not enough, the config.inc.php file itself has to have a mode which 
         allows the webserver to rewrite this file. -> do a "chmod" on the config.inc.php file directly<br><br>

                  But the file IS in it's right place! what can I do?<br>
<b>A:</b>This is an incompatibilty between php 4.2.x and apache 2.x version. For a workaround see here

<b>Q:</b>Is it possible to use the apache version 2.0.43 (or similar)?<br>

<b>A:</b>Generally yes but we observed a lot problems with the combination php4/apache 2.0.x at the moment (end 2002),

<b>Q:</b>How do I perform an update?<br>
<b>A:</b>PHProjekt has an automatic update routine. You have to distinct beween maintainance updates (a change 
in the version number at the third position, e.g. 3.2.0 -> 3.2.1) or an update or upgrade with enhanced features
(e.g. 3.2 -> 3.3 or 3.3 -> 4.0). In the first case you simply have to copy the files over the old ones, int the
latter case you have to run setup.php with the 'update to new version' option, the setup routine will do the rest.<br />
Attention: always backup your system (= database and the whole directory) before an update! You can use the addon
'PHProjekt backup system' to manage your backups.<br><br>

<b>Q:</b>After the upload, the uploaded file exists in /tmp but the copy routine fails!<br>
<b>A:</b>Have a look into the php.ini whether the /tmp dir is indeed the upload dir! Otherwise you have to adjust this

<b>Q:</b>In the forum on the PHProjekt homepage someone told me to raise the error reporting level to

<b>A:</b>Put a comment before this line in the index.php and lib/lib.inc.php:
         error_reporting(0);
         by adding two slashes in the beginning of the line:
         // error_reporting(0);
         and remove these slashes in the next line:
         // error_reporting( E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE); to

<b>Q:</b>During the setup I get this: "Session error! Please set the correct temp path in

<b>A:</b>Please ensure that:
         - this directory exists<br>
         - the webserver is able to read and write files there<br>
         - you wrote the path correctly, especially windows can cause trouble here (try all combinations like c:\tmp, C:/tmp etc.)<br><br>

<b>Q:</b>During the setup I get this message: "Session error! Please set the correct temp path in

<b>A:</b>If you rent webspace at a provider tell him that the sessions of php4 don't work correctly and 
         ask him to fix this. If you host by yourself then you have to find the php.ini on your system 
         and set the path in the session.save_path to a directory where the webserver can read and write. <br><br>
         Another user reported that setting the sessiondata directory below the php directory for read and write

<b>Q:</b>Trying the database conncetion test in the test routine gives me a blank page! Any clues?<br>
<b>A:</b>Many reasons could be responsible that the db test fails. this test simply checks whether there
         is an active connection to the given database. Please read the chapter 'database' in this FAQ for further
         hints. If the whole screen is blank then you should check whether your php has the support of your
         mentioned database system enabled att all. You can check this by running the phpinfo() function and see
         whether there is a section about your chosen db.<br><br>
