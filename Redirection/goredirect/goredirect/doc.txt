DOCUMENTATION

You will find the following files in the archive.

   1. go.php - the actual redirector script
   2. goredirect.sql - the MySQL script to configure the database
   3. license.txt - a copy of the BSD license
   4. doc.txt - this page
   5. goconfig.php - variables specific to your installation of MySQL

Plus a folder named admin containing:

   1. index.php - the basic statistics page
   2. add.php - add a link page
   3. delete.php - remove a link page
   4. report.php - detailed link statistics on a month/day breakdown

Installation Instructions

Step 1: Uncompress the archive anywhere you like.

Step 2: In your MySQL server, run the goredirect.sql script. You can also copy and paste into phpMyAdmin, SQLyog, or your choice of front end.

Step 3: Edit the database connection variables in goconfig.php as appropriate for your MySQL installation.

Step 4: Place the go.php and a copy of the goconfig.php scripts at the document root in your web server. (i.e. /var/www/html/ or c:\apache\htdocs)

Step 5: Place the admin folder wherever you like. You may wish to use authentication to protect it if it contains important information.

That's it for install.

Directions for Use

Step 1: Use the admin/index.php script to add and remove URLs as well as view statistics.

Step 2: In your web site, follow this basic format to create trackable links:

/go.php?id=xxx

where xxx is a number corresponding to the row in MySQL.

Step 3: Use the MySQL tool of choice to do detailed reporting beyond what the current link manager provides.
