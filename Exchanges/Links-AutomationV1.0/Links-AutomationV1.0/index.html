                          unlike any other on the Internet. Our system works exactly 
                          the opposite of other link exchange services. Instead 
                          of requiring you to submit individual link exchange 
                          requests one-by-one to all of our members, we instantly 
                          add your link onto all of ourmember's websites immediately</p>
                        <p>Becoming a member of the Links-Automation.com link 
                          exchange directory is a very simple process that can 
                          take less than ten minutes to complete. After signing 
                          up as a member to our service, you will be prompted 
                          to enter your website address, select an appropriate 
                          category for it, enter a title and description, and 
                          place a link on your home page pointing to your links 
                          page. We will supply the code for your links page, or 
                          if you'd prefer, we will even create and host your links 
                          page for you on our domain. As soon as you complete 
                          these simple steps, a link to your website will go live 
                          on all of our member's websites. The whole process is 
                          completely automated!</p>
                        <p><strong>The benefits of becoming a Links-Automation.com 
                          member include:</strong></p>
                        <p>Drive new traffic to your website from exchanging links 
                          with our members.</p>
                        <p>Freedom from the tedious duties of exchanging links 
                          manually one-by-one.</p>
                        <p>Increase your link popularity with the major search 
                          engines and directories.</p>
                        <p>Exchange links automatically every time a new member

                        <p>To increase the number of incoming links to your website, 
                          you have two options. You can take the slow route of 
                          exchanging links one-by-one with other websites, or 
                          you can join the Links-Automation.com automated link 
                          exchange program. Manually exchanging links with other 
                          websites is a slow and tedious process that will take 
                          many months of hard work to increase your website traffic 
                          and your link popularity. Becoming a member of Links-Automation.com 
                          will instantly provide you with thousands of quality 
                          incoming links to your website, and also allow you the 
                          freedom to focus on your other important duties. Who 
                          wants to sit around all day spending all their time 
                          exchanging links the old-fashioned way? </p>
                        <p>We make sure that the Links-Automation.com link exchange 
                          directory adheres to the guidelines of all the major 
                          search engines. The search engines do not frown upon 
                          webmasters exchanging links with each other - as a matter 
                          of fact, they encourage it. Here is a direct quote from 
                          Google's webmaster guidelines: &quot;The best way to 
                          ensure Google finds your site is for your page to be 
                          linked from lots of pages on other sites. Google's robots 
                          jump from page to page on the Web via hyperlinks, so 
                          the more sites that link to you, the more likely it 
                          is that we'll find you quickly.&quot; Our service simply 
                          automates your link exchange duties to make your life 
                          easier. It is not a &quot;link farm&quot;, nor does 
                          it artificially manipulate the search engines.</p>
                        <p>Our system completely automates the process of exchanging 
                          links with other websites, leaving you free to focus 
                          on other duties. There may be other link exchange programs 
                          out there that claim to help automate your link exchange 
                          duties for you, but they still require you to submit 
                          link exchange requests and reply to them one-by-one. 
                          We take care of the entire link exchange process for 
                          you! Why waste your precious time with this tedious 
                          task any longer when we can manage your entire link 
                          exchange program for<strong> free</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Complete automation of your entire link exchange program 
                          from start to finish. There are other link exchange 
                          services that boast of automation, but none of them 
                          even come close to offering the freedom from time-consuming 
                          link exchange duties that Links-Automation.com offers. 
                          We dare you to compare us and find out for yourself! 
                          Our unique system is unlike any other link exchange 
                          program available on the Internet.</p>

                          individual link exchange requests and waiting for approval!</p>
                        <p><strong>No need to worry about linking to inappropriate 
                          or dead websites.</strong> Unlike other link exchange 
                          programs that are nothing more than link farms with 
                          pages full of links, our system consists of a fully 
                          searchable, categorized website directory that is maintained 
                          by a team of human editors. Links that contain any pornographic 
                          or inappropriate content are deactivated until it is 
                          removed. Also, our robot regularly crawls member's websites 
                          to make sure there are no dead or missing links.</p>
                        <p>We make it easy! Most link exchange programs still 
                          require you to submit and reply to link exchange requests. 
                          We take care of them for you. After initially configuring 
                          your account, y<strong>ou will never have to submit 
                          or answer another link exchange request - ever!</strong> 
                          Now you can get back to focusing on your business again.</p>
                        <p><strong>Use your own links page, or let us host one 
                          for you</strong>. Once you become a member, we will 
                          initially provide you with a few simple lines of code 
                          to place on your links page. Our automated system will 
                          then continually update the links on your website's 
                          link page dynamically. You will never have to worry 
                          about checking for broken links or improper category 
                          placement. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>You never have to give out your email address 
                          to other members.</strong> Unlike other link exchange 
                          programs, our members do not have to respond to link 
                          exchange requests with other members to get new link 
                          partners. That means your email address will never become 
                          vulnerable to spammers as a result of participating 
                          in our program. </p>
                        <p><strong>Works in addition to your existing link exchange 
                          program.</strong> If you already have an existing reciprocal 
                          link exchange program on your website, our program can 
                          work in conjunction with it. You can either place our 
                          code on your existing links page, or start a new links 
                          page on your website.</p>
                        <p><strong>Choose the option of either reciprocal or one-way 
                          linking.</strong> If you prefer to have incoming links 
                          to your website that are non-reciprocal, you can choose 
                          to have us host your links page on our servers. Since 
                          your links page will be on our domain, the links on 
                          it will not be considered as reciprocal links by the
