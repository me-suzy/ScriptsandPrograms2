  MyBannerExchange<br>
  </u></b>Installation Instructions<br>
  <br>
  </font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first 
  thing you'll need to do is configure your MySQL settings. Open <b>config.php</b> 
  in Notepad or another text editor. The first 4 variables ($sqlhost, $sqllogin, 
  $sqlpass, $sqldb) need to be configured with your MySQL settings. These settings 
  are your MySQL Hostname, Username, Password, and Database Name. The other variable, 
  $table, is the table name to be created, and can be left as it is unless you 
  really need to change it.<br>
  <br>
  <b>$bx_url</b> must be set to the FULL URL that points to MyBannerExchange. 
  It <b>must</b> end with a trailing slash! It should point to a directory, NOT 
  a file.<br>
  <b>$bx_title</b> should be a one-word title of your existing website that MyBannerExchange 
  will be running with. This appears in the title bar of each page along with 
  the individual title of that page. For example, on my copy of the script, $bx_title 
  = &quot;NukedWeb&quot; and the signup page shows &quot;NukedWeb: Create Your 
  Account&quot; in the titlebar.<br>
  <b>$hours_must_be_active</b> represents the number of hours an account is inactive 
  before it's removed from the banner cycle. This feature safeguards against people 
  that remove the code from their site, or never put the code in at all. If that 
  paerson does not send a hit from the banner on their site within xx hours, their 
  banner is not shown on any other site. Banners will continue being shown on 
  their site, and when they finally do send a hit, it'll automatically be reinstated 
  into the system. This feature also prevents dead-beat no-traffic websites from 
  sucking up hits from high-trafic sites. :) <b>Note: </b>You can set a specific 
  account, most likely your own, to be exempt from this time interval. This can 
  be done through the admin page.<br>
  <b>$adminpass</b> is the password for the administration area. Change this now!! 
  :)<br>
  <br>
  The other variables....<br>
  The head and foot files are files containing HTML that appears at the top and 
  bottom of your website. You can use the head.php and foot.php that came with 
  the script, or point the script to the location of the existing files. The other 
  variables in this section should need no detailed explanation. They control 
  the design of the signup and login pages, as well as button texts, page titles, 
  etc. <br>
  <br>
  Save <b>config.php</b> and upload it to your website. Also upload <b>create_table.php</b> 
  to the same place. Now access your website through your browser, and access 
  /create_table.php. You'll be prompted with further instructions from there.<br>
  <br>
  Now, for the categories. The categories are kept in categories.txt. They're 
  formatted to include subcategories too. Notice subcategories are separated by 
  a space, dash, space. If you add/edit categories, it's <b>very important</b> 
  that you format it this way, because the script sometimes parses category names 
  using the &quot; - &quot;. Review the categories and add/edit/remove them. It's 
  best that you do this now! If you remove a category later that someone has listed 
  themselves under, they may not ever show up in the banner cycle.<br>
  <br>
  <b>An explanation to targeted banners...<br>
  </b>I want to take a minute or two to explain to you how this works. When a 
  person signs up using a specific category, by default they'll have banners of 
  that same category on their site. Now obviously, when you first get your service 
  going, each person may be the only one in their subcategory, or even the only 
  one in their main category. The script compensates for this. The script first 
  checks to see if there's another site in that category. If there is, it displays 
  it. If not, it then checks to see if there's another site in that main category. 
  If not, it tries a third time by checking the entire database for another banner 
  to display, regardless of category. If THAT fails, that means you only have 
  one account in your database that's considered &quot;active&quot;. You should 
  at least add your own banner by creating your own account, and then set it for 
  &quot;exempt&quot; on the admin page. :)<br>
  <br>
  Now everything's ready! Upload all the files, including files you've just made 
  changes to, to the folder on your website where MyBannerExhcange will be running 
  from. Access <b>create.php</b> through your web browser and create your own 
  account. Remember to go to the admin area afterwards and make your account exempt 
  from the time interval.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To access the 
  admin page, access <b>admin.php</b> from your browser. From here you can list/edit/remove 
  users, and add/delete exempt status. Enter the password you chose when configuring 
  the config file.</font></p>
