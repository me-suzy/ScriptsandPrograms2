	Note: Please replace data in [] with appropriate information. Please see the index.php file for an example. -[...] indicates optional information. -[Location] only needs to be used if the download.php class cannot find the database folder.  This could be in the form of "../database/", remember to include the leading /. The default is "database/".

5. Start using the Download COunter!

NOTE: For ideal results, place the database folder and the download.php file on the root folder of your website.  If you get errors when accessing the page, you may need to include multiple copies of the file in directories where used, use this option as a last resort.
