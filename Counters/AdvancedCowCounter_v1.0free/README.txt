The Advanced CowCounter is a much much larger version of the original CowCounter. The Advanced CowCounter can handle multiple counters at one time building statistics and keeping track of useful information. Each time someone trips one of your counters, an entry is made in a MySQL database that keeps track of what counter they tripped, the time and day, their IP address, and browser information. Currently you can only count hits but statistics on what browser people are using and what OS they are using are on the horizon. The current counters are a Hit Counter (standard image counter), a Page Access Counter (a hidden version of the Hit Counter), and a Link Counter (counts how many people click on a link). There is no java, javascript, CSS, Perl, CGI, Flash, or Shockwave. For a browser, you only need to have a browser that understands HTML (all of them :)) and can load a few images. Installation is pretty straight forward, simply extract the ZIP file, upload all of the files (keeping the small directory structure intact), and go to the directory that you uploaded the files to (specifically the index.php file in the directory you uploaded to). Only a small amount of HTML knowledge is necessary - how to put an image on your page and how to create a link, both for putting the counters on your pages.


If you are new to this, then you need to have a web server running with php installed and configured with the GD v2.0 extension and working correctly along with access to a MySQL Server. Once you have that, then just copy all of these files to a directory of your choosing, and run the installation program by going to the index.php file located in the directory of your choosing. Once completed, you can use the help file for more information.
