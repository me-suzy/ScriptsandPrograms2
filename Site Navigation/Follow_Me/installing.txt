FOLLOW ME - AUTOMATIC DYNAMIC MENUS - V1.1

---------------------------------------

Generates fully customisable auto expandable menus, based on text file, no database connection needed.


The code will : 
- generate automatically a navigation menu.
- display all the links and open/close collapsible menus when needed. 
- unlink the current position. 



The structure allows to use up to 3 different levels:

[r] main level, stands for "Rubrique" (heading)

[s] section, are the main sections. 

[ss-] subsections, all content displayed inside your [s] sections. "-" is to be replaced with the section's number 

note : [s] and [ss-] can be placed in a specific folder or just remain in the main directory.







Three operations are required : 

1/ Copy "menu.inc" in the main folder.
--------------------------------------



2/ Build a content.txt file, including all titles and paths to the files.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content.txt is to be placed in the main [r] directory, with menu.inc


Delimiters : 
[_]Text to be displayed#/path/to/file.php!



=> example  :http://www.mysite.com/test/ with  3 sections

folders : section1, section2, 
files concerning section3 stay in the main folder.

Example of Content.txt (only section 1 and 3 have sub-content)

[r]Main Title#/test/index.php!
[s]section 1#/test/section1/section1.php!
[ss1]soussection 1-1#/test/section1/ssection1-1.php!
[ss1]soussection 1-2#/test/section1/ssection1-2.php!
[ss1]soussection 1-3#/test/section1/ssection1-3.php!
[s]section 2#/test/section2/section2.php!
[s]section 3#/test/section3.php!
[ss3]soussection 3-1#/test/ssection3-1.php!



3/ ensure content of the left menu table in pages contains the appropriate php code.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ensure your pages follow this structure:  

**for the index.php main page (identified as [r]) or all [s] and [ss-] files if placed in the main folder **
<? require("menu.inc") ;?> 


**for all other pages [s] and [ss-] when placed in a specific folder **
<? $sousrep="../"; require("../menu.inc");?>
