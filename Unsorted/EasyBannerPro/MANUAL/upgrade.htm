                    <p><font face="Verdana,arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b><font color="#FF0000">Update from version 
2.7<br><br></font></b></font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="black">These 
instruction are valid only for users who have version 2.7. If you have an older 
version, you must update to version 2.7 first and then update to version 2.8.<br><br>First of all make a database backup (if possible) and download it to your desktop. Download also 
                    file data.php (data directory). By following these 
                    steps you will be able to restore your data if something 
                     goes wrong.<br><br>Then delete all files in the 
main and admin directories, also delete directory &quot;messages&quot; (inside 
data directory). Then follow instructions 
                    for installation - upload files, set permissions.  
                    Do not upload setup.php. Then run script update.php by your browser.<br><br>Once this script tells you that the update is completed, go to the Admin Area. From 
the menu on the left click on Configuration and set up some 
                    new variables, also several old variables must be entered 
again. After all the new variables will be set, you should run function &quot;Fix Ads&quot; 
- for all the ad sizes you use. Also please set up again your default banners, 
if you have translated or changed messages, you must do it again as well. If 
you use Crontab or Task Manager to run&nbsp;daily/weekly jobs, you will need to update it. 
Please </font><a href="rebuild.htm"><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="blue">click 
here</font></a><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="black"> for more 
info. If you use sponsor packages, you must update all the packages you have 
because there are also some changes.<br><br>We also recommend to check out if 
all works well as this is a really radical update.<br><br>Note: As you can see, 
weekly statistic has been removed and there is now new monthly (month-by-month) statistic. This 
new monthly statistic is counted from the time of the update, there will not be available monthly 
statistic for months before the update.<br>&nbsp;</font></p>
