Banner Pro has one  job which must to be run on&nbsp;daily basis - Daily Job.<br>It 
must be running daily after midnight. It copies statistic of the previous day 
to the day-by-day and month-by-month statistics,  </font><SPAN class=text10><font face="Verdana" size="2">deletes all IP records used in the anti-cheat protection, converts daily portion of the 'Deferred free impressions' to normal free 
impressions and deletes unpaid sponsor orders older than 7 days. You can run 
this job also manually in the Admin Area, however it's not recommended.<br>Please 
note that <b>it's very important to run the daily job immediately after midnight</b> 
to have the statistic as accurate as possible.<br><br>There are 3 different ways to run this job:<br><b>Automatically</b> 
- just check field 'Run t</font></SPAN><SPAN class="text13"><font face="Verdana" size="2">he daily and weekly jobs 
automatically' in your Configuration. This is a very easy way but it needs additional 
system resources and it is not recommended. You should never use this way if you 
have more than 30,000 impressions/day.<br><b>By Crontab (Linux) or Task Manager 
(Windows)</b> - it's the best way but there is needed a little more setting. 
You can read below how to set a Cron on your server. If you use 
this way, never check '</font></SPAN><SPAN class=text10><font face="Verdana" size="2">Run 
t</font></SPAN><SPAN class="text13"><font face="Verdana" size="2">he daily  job 
automatically' in the Configuration.<br><b>Manually</b> - You can run this

<P><font face="Verdana" size="2">You will need to figure out if you will be using 
lynx or wget to perform the Cron tasks. These are both programs that are 
commonly available on Linux and Unix servers, but not always. You will need to 
locate one of these programs on your server. If you do not know where they can 
be found, contact your server administrator to get that information. You will 
need the full path to the program (ie /usr/bin/lynx).<br><br>Please note that 
if you set up in your Configuration that time on the server is different from 
a real time, you must move also the Daily Job. For example if there is +2 hours 
difference, you have to run the Daily Job after 2 am.</font></P>
<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="blue">You have to add one of 
                    the following lines to your Cron tasks.<br>
		    </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">It 
                    runs this job daily at 0:01 am, it's very important to run 
them immediately after a midnight.<br><br>If 
                    you will be using wget, the line is (all between '1' and 
                    'ip'):</font><br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You must replace &quot;/path/to/wget&quot; 
                    or &quot;/path/to/lynx&quot; with real path to wget or lynx.<br>You 
                    also must replace &quot;http://www.yourdomain.com/easybannerprodirectory/rebuild.php&quot; 
                    by a real URL of your rebuild.php file. Also replace &quot;yoursecretword&quot; 
                    by your secret word you have entered in the </font><SPAN class="text13"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Configuration</font></SPAN><font face="Verdana" size="2">.<br><br>These 
                    are only samples. You may want to change the times if you 
                    are familiar with Cron.<br><br>
