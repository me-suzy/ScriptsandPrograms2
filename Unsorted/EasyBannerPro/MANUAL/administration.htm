                    <p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="black">Below 
is a short description of some functions available in the Admin Area.<br><br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><b><font color="#FF0000">Configuration</font></b><br>
				Before you will run your exchange system, you 
                    should fill in all necessary fields in Configuration. Be aware 
                    while settings of your values. You have a limited space 
                    on pages of your members (this space you can set as width 
                    and height of the table with exchange links) and if the&nbsp;links 
                    of your members will be too long or too big, a piece of 
                    the links may be hidden.<br>If you already have some members 
                    and need to change any value marked by * in your Configuration, 
                    you should then use&nbsp;function Fix ads. 
                    This function corrects all links of your members in compliance 
                    with your actual variables. If you will forget to use this 
                    function, links of your members stay identical as before.<br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="blue">If 
                    you already have members and want to modify categories</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">: 
                    If you want to add categories, add it to the end of the 
                    listing, never change order of existing categories. The 
                    script uses numbers instead of names for categories so if 
                    you have (let's say) categories Music,Computers,Kids,TV 
                    and then you change it to Music,World,Kids,TV,Computers 
                    so all accounts&nbsp;from category Computers get category 
                    World. If you really need change order of categories or 
                    need remove any category, you&nbsp;then need update category 
                    of each account by hand in your admin area.<br><br></font><font face="Verdana,arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b><font color="#FF0000">Default

				Before you will run your exchange system, you 
                    should set up your default links - this function may be 
                    found in the Admin Area. These links are displayed if no one 
                    account in the necessary category has available credits. 
                    You can have different default links for each category. 
                    If you will choose to use the same links for all categories, 
                    it will be used for all accounts in the relevant exchange 
                    size.</font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b><font color="#FF0000"><br><br>Database backup/restore functions<br></font></b>You 
                    can use our own function to backup/restore your database 
                    or you can use Mysqldump. This is a small program which 
                    is installed on most Unix/Linux servers but not at all. 
                    It is recommended to use the Mysqldump backup, however if you cannot use this, just 
                    uncheck the field and use our own function. Please be patient, 
                    it may take up to a few minutes until your database will 
                    be saved or restored.<br>The backup file is saved into your 
&quot;data&quot; directory, you can download it and use to restore your&nbsp;data 
if you need it. Please note that the backup file contains only data, not structure 
of tables. You must have Easy Banner Pro installed to be able restore the 
database.<br><br></font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="red"><b>Blacklist</b></font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><br>You

				totally damage your exchange system. You may again upload it if you will need to make any changes.<br>To 
                    optimize your system you should remove inactive users regularly, 
                    especially if you have a lot of members.<br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br><br>&nbsp;</font></body>
