(exchange) users must show banners of other users on their pages while sponsored 
(paid) users can purchase impressions or clicks.<br><br>How it works:<br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">You create any number of sponsor 
packages. Sponsored users can select from these 
packages when they want to add funds to their accounts. Once a sponsored user 
orders a package, he/she gets a button or link leading to your payment processor 
(for example PayPal or any other). This button or link will be based on the HTML 
which you entered before. Once you will be informed 
by your payment processor that the payment is completed, you have to go into the 
Admin Area of Easy Banner Pro and mark that order as paid. When it happens, the 
user can immediately use the purchased funds to create a new ad or to add new 
impressions or clicks to an existing ad.</font><font size="2" color="black" face="Verdana"><BR></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="black"><br>Notes:<br>D</font><SPAN class="text13"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="black">on't forget to set up a price for 100 clicks and 1000 
impressions in your Configuration (this price may be different for each ad size).<br>Orders not marked as paid which are older that 7 days are&nbsp;automatically 
deleted. Also sponsor accounts created 7 or more days ago which don't have any 
orders are automatically deleted.<br></font></SPAN></p>
