Easy Banner Pro. Please read this Manual carefully, it contains useful information 
how to install and use this script.<br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="red"><b><br>Introduction</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br><br>Easy 
Banner  Pro is an advanced script for running your own banner exchange system. 
Each user can have up to 3 accounts (different banner sizes) with up to 3 ads in each of these accounts. It 
means that each user may have maximum of 9 different banners.&nbsp;You have a lot of 
options in the Admin Area, many features may be changed or disabled if you don't 
want them.<br><br>All public 
pages are based on templates - these are normal HTML&nbsp;or text files and may be 
edited in your favorite HTML or text editor. These templates contain a special 
tags which look like '#%someword%#'. These tags are replaced by a value by the scripts. All templates may be found 
in 'data/templates' directory. HTML templates are always used to show some complete 
HTML page. TXT templates with name which begins to the word 'email' are always used 
to send an email. Please take a note that <b>in all email templates must 
the first line always begin by the word &quot;Subject: &quot; and below this line 
must be one blank line</b></font><FONT face="Verdana" color=#000000 size=2>, then will be the text of the email.<br><br> On the top of each public page is automatically 
inserted content of file '</FONT><font size="2" face="Verdana">_head.txt'. 
At the end of each public page is automatically inserted content of file '_footer.txt'. 
Both these files are in the 'data/templates' directory. You can use these files 
to add some data to each public page. It may save you a</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> lot of time when you 
will need to change something on all pages.<br><br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>Non-English 
characters</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><br>The 
default character set which we use in all pages is </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">ISO-8859-1. 
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">If you use non-English 
characters, you should change character set of your pages in order to show them 
properly in all browsers. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you need to 
modify it, find this in files &quot;data/templates/_head.txt&quot; and &quot;admin/_head.txt&quot;.<br><br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="red"><b>Statistic</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>Easy 
Banner Pro offers many pages with statistic, there is available overall statistic 
(since you installed or reseted it) and monthly statistic. The overall statistic 
is always a real time but the statistic for the current month may be delayed&nbsp;several 
hours.<br><br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><br>&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
