<h3><a name=step1>Step 1: Install CSLH</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  ONLINE WEB INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
RECOMENDED:<br>
<br>
1) Upload all of the files extracted from the zip or tar 
   file onto your web host.  
<br><br>
2) Make sure owner/group for your virutalhost or webserver 
   is set to you. 
   <br><br>
   If not or you do not know what I am talking 
   about change the permissions of the files named: config.php 
   to 777 to allow the web setup program 
   access to change it. If you plan in installing using
   a text based database you will also need to change the 
   permissions of the directory txt-database to 777. 
   If you need more help on this
   just open up the setup.php page and more directions 
   will appear.
<br><br>
3) Open up the setup.php file in your web browser like so:
   http://www.yourdomainname.com/livehelp/setup.php
<br><br>
4) follow the online installation..
<br><br>
5) IMPORTANT: 
   After the setup is finished change the permissions of 
   config.php to either 755 or 400 
   (Depending on your server setup) but leave txt-database
   writable by the webserver. 
  <br><br>  
MANUAL INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
DO THIS ONLY IF YOU CAN NOT RUN THE SETUP.php and 
Plan on using MySQL as the database. if you want to
use txt-db-api you need to run the setup.php
   <br><br>
1) Open up config.php and change the configuration 
   settings to match your configuration (mysql user, admin etc..)
<br><br>
2) Create a database on your Mysql server and 
   import tables.sql 
<br><br>
3) Log in as 
   username: admin
   password: admin
   <br><br>
   YOU SHOULD CHANGE THIS AFTER LOGGING IN BY CLICKING PREFERENCES
   <br><br>
