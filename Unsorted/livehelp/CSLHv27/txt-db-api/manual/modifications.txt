I added a few functions to database.php to help make this class match the 
function names and the array structure of mysql_options.php
class. I also added support for the basic ALTER sql query .
Please look for this text in the code to see the code segments
created by me:
" BEGIN CODE INSERTED BY ERIC GERDES"
" END CODE INSERTED BY ERIC GERDES"
