HOW TO UPGRADE:
----------------------------------
1) Rename your current livehelp folder
   that contains all the php files for 
   your current live help to something 
   like livehelp_old on the server.

2) Upload the new livehelp folder to 
   the server and rename the newly uploaded
   folder to livehelp or whatever you 
   had named the old livehelp 
   installation folder as.
   
3) Open up setup.php and select UPGRADE
   as the installation option. For the
   Mysql database Be sure to 
   use the same database name, user and 
   password used in the first installtion 
   If you do nto remember what this was
   open up the old config.php file and 
   look for the corrisponding lines.

Example:
---------
In this upgrade example lets pretend your
livehelp is in a folder called "livehelp"   
This is what you would do in the Unix 
prompt:

mv livehelp livehelp_old
tar xfz CSLHv26.tar.gz
mv CSLHv26 livehelp

Then open up setup.php in a web browser 
and select Upgrade as the installation.
