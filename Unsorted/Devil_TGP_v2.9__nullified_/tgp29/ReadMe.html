  <p><b><font face="Verdana">TGPDevil Thumbnail Preview Add-On</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">Setup</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"> Setup is pretty simple. 
    First, upload the scripts included in the .zip file replacing the old scripts. 
    Replace your old submit form and partner submit form with the forms included 
    in the .zip. Make sure the scripts permissions are set to 755. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Set the variables in the 
    config file. There are a few new variables in the config file:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">$mondir</font><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"> 
    - This is the full system path of the directory you would like the thumbs 
    to be uploaded to.<br>
    <font color="#FF0000">$monurl</font> - This is the URL of the directory you 
    set with $mondir.<br>
    <font color="#FF0000">$maxsize</font> - This is the max size of the image 
    (in bytes)that you will allow to be uploaded. The script will count everything 
    submitted to it INCLUDING the text from the fields the submitter filled out 
    so I would recommend adding about 1024 (1K) to whatever value you have chosen.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Now call install.cgi in 
    your browser. You should be provided with a message that the database setup 
    was completed successfully.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">Congratulations! The hardest 
    part is over with.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Log in to your admin panel 
    and go to your template management area. You will notice a new template in 
    the list called &quot;Thumbnail Image Preview Template&quot;. This is basically 
    the same as the regular line template as it controls the way your image appears 
    on the generated page. Below is an example of a good thumbnail image preview 
    template. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"> 
    <textarea name="textfield2" rows="4" cols="100">&lt;a href="#URL#"&gt;&lt;img src="#IMGURL#" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</textarea>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Obviously #URL# will be 
    replaced by the URL to the gallery and #IMGURL# will be replaced by the URL 
    to the thumbnail on your server.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000"><font color="#FF0000">You 
    will need to save a thumbnail image preview template before you can continue!</font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Last step!</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Edit your main gallery 
    page template and place the tag <b><font color="#FF0000">#-THUMB-#</font></b> 
    wherever you would like a thumbnail to appear. Thumbnails are ordered in the 
    same way as regular text links. By date, rank, and order submitted. Newer/higher 
    ranked thumbs appear higher on the days listings.</font></p>
