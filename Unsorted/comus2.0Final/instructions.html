<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Including tgpinc.php and archiveinc.php files</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Both of these files should be used as includes within your 
    site design. As an example, create your TGP main page and 
    save it as &quot;tgp.php&quot; Within this page, decide where 
    you want the TGP list to be displayed and enter the following 
    (without quotes) <br>
    &quot;&lt;?php include($DOCUMENT_ROOT . &quot;/includes/tgpinc.php&quot;) 
    ?&gt;&quot;. Do the same for your archive.php page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Approving Posts</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Within the admin section of the site, you can view, approve 
    or deny posts. To view a post, just click on the link in the 
    left hand column. To approve or deny posts, simply select 
    the yes or no radio buttons and hit &quot;update&quot;. You 
    can also select a rating from 1 to 10 for each gallery. Lower 
    numbers will show up higher in the listing than the higher 
    ones. The default setting is 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Black list</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>First decide if you want to use the Blacklist feature. If 
    you do, select &quot;Yes&quot; in the admin configuration 
    page. </p>
  <p>To add someone to the blacklist, enter their email address or domain by using 
    the form on the blacklist page. To remove someone from the list, just click 
    on &quot;delete&quot; next to their email address. Before a new post is submitted 
    to the site, the submitters email address and domain name are checked against 
    this list. If they are on it, they are informed of being on the blacklist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Preferred submitter</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>First decide if you want to use the Preferred Submitter feature. 
    If you do, select &quot;Yes&quot; in the admin configuration 
    page. </p>
  <p>To add someone to the preferred submitter list, enter their 
    email address by using the form on the preferred submitter 
    page. To remove them, click on &quot;delete&quot; next to 
    their email address. All posts are checked against the preferred 
    submitter list. If they are on the list, the posts show up 
    on the live site right away and do not need to be approved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Require Reciprocal Link</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>First decide if you want to require a reciprocal link. If 
    you do, select &quot;Yes&quot; in the admin configuration 
    page.</p>
  <p>If this feature is turned on, the submitter will be required 
    to have a link back to you on their page. Before the post 
    is accepted by the script, it will check their page for your 
    link-back. If its not there, the post is rejected and they 
    are informed that a link-back is required. If the script finds 
    a link-back, the post is accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Checking links</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Click on a group to check. A page will load and it will check 
    all links associated with that category. After a while, a 
    table will show up listing the status of each link, if they 
    have your recip link or not, if they have a pop-up window 
    on the page, if they have any banned words on their page. 
    From this resulting page, you can check the links by clicking 
    on them. For all the galleries you would like to delete, simply 
    check on the box next to them and hit submit button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Bad word check</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This feature will check the gallery page and subject line 
    for any words that you choose. If you want to use this feature, 
    just select Yes in the admin setup area and add the words 
    you want to search for in the. Just make sure that you separate 
    the words with a comma. The search will also look for partial 
    words... so if you ban &quot;cat&quot; and they have &quot;catatonic&quot; 
    on their site... it will catch it and stop them from posting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Use Confirm email</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you have this option set to yes, all non-preferred submissions 
    will be emailed to the webmaster and they will have to reply 
    to that email before you ever see it. This helps weed out 
    junk postings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Limit Archive Post View</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You can limit how many galleries show up in the archive pages. 
    If you start getting thousands of posts, you might want to 
    think of limiting the number that show on the site.. Because 
    if you try to show them all, it will take forever to load.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Tradescript Support</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you are using a traffic trading script, select Yes and 
    add your connection strings below. All code that goes before 
    the gallery URL goes in the top box and all code after the 
    URL goes on the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="6">Using the Templates:</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><font size="6"> <font size="4">Variable list that you can use for your 
    tgp gallery listing</font></font></b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>%cat% = Category of gallery<br>
      %url% = URL pointing to gallery<br>
      %desc% = Description of gallery<br>
      %date% = Date of listing<br>
      %nick% =Nickname of person submitting gallery <br>
      %numpic% = Number of images in the gallery<br>
      %pp% = This is &lt;b&gt; and used to single out preferred submitters.<br>
      %pk% = The other end of %pp% and is converted to &lt;/b&gt; to close the 
      bold tag.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The templates are basically plain html that are inserted into your emails or 
  webpage.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the Gallery Template that will produce a single cloumn 
  looking like:</p>
<p>02/28/02 <a href="##"><b>Hot Horny Chick</b></a></p>
<p>%date% &lt;A HREF=&quot;%url%&quot; target=&quot;_tgp&quot;&gt;%pp%%desc%%pk%&lt;/A&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="6">Setting up your site.....</font></b></p>
<p>As I mentioned in the install instructions, the heart of the script is the 
  tgpinc.php file. This will be included into your tgp page to display your galleries. 
  There are 2 different ways you can use this. One is to include it and have a 
  single list of all your galleries....</p>
<p>Sample 1</p>
<p><font color="red">&lt;? include($DOCUMENT_ROOT . &quot;/includes/tgpinc.php&quot;); 
  ?&gt;</font></p>
<p>This will make the list look like this...</p>
<p> Gallery one<br>
  Gallery two<br>
  Gallery three<br>
  And so on.....</p>
<p>The other is to have yoru categories listed in seperate tables.</p>
<p>Sample 2</p>
<p> &lt;? $onlycat = &quot;Amateurs&quot;;<br>
  include($DOCUMENT_ROOT . &quot;/includes/tgpinc.php&quot;); ?&gt;</p>
<p>Please take a careful look at sample2.php and see how this is used. Please 
  note, you will need to have each of these categories listed in your database... 
  so, whatever you have defined for $onlycat= it needs to be an actual category.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose to use to use, they will both use the 'list gallery template' 
  you have designed in your template setup.</p>
