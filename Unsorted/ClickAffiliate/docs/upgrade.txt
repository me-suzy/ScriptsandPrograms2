	Instructions for upgrade from version 2.x to 3.x (PRO)

You can upgrade from ClickAffiliate v.2.x or ClickAffiliate PRO v.2.x
#--------------------------------------------------------------------


You can upgrade from v2 to PRO version (v3) with the reg2sql.cgi script provided in the ClickAffiliate PRO
distribution. If you still have v1, you need to ypgrade first to v2, according to instructions provided 
into v.2 distributions of ClickAffiliate and ClickAffiliate PLUS. 


This upgrade allows you to convert .dat files and members.txt file into mySQL DB entries. You can therefore 
upgrade to PRO version without loosing major data.

You will preserve: 
- members personal data
- current clicks which are unpaid
- total payed value for each member

You will loose:
- history of old click ammount (paid ones)
- current click log
- click URL and IP origin 




#--------------------------------------------------------------------
		IMPORT instructions
#--------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to install the v3 version (PRO) first and have created the new mySQL database and tables. 
Refer to 
docs.txt to do it.


Once you have PRO version ready, follow these steps to import previous version data:

1- Edit reg2sql.cgi file.

Near the top of reg2sql.cgi you will find a zone of variables. You need to edit those variables
to reflect your configuration and v.2.x parameters (define the path to members.txt, click rate, etc.)

Look in config.cgi of PRO version and in config.cgi of v.2.x.


2- Execute reg2sql.cgi from within the same folder where your previous version resides.

3- Once you have the "OK. Done" message, your data should have been imported. Enter your PRO version and 
search for users. You should see all your affiliates in the new PRO version. 


That's it.
