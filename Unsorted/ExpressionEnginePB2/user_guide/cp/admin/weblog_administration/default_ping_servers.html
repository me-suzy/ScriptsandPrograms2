	<h1>Default Ping Servers</h1>

	<p>This section of the Control Panel allows you to define your default ping servers.  Ping servers are for sites that allow you to send a "ping" to them to let them know that you've posted a new entry.  Examples include <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">weblogs.com</a> and <a href="http://blo.gs/">Blo.gs</a>, among others.  These default servers are always available when creating a new entry unless the user's personal settings have been changed under <dfn><a href="../../my_account/">My Account</a></dfn>.</p>



	<h2><a name="main_screen">Main Screen</a></h2>

	<p>The main <dfn>Default Ping Servers</dfn> screen shows a table of all the existing ping servers.  All entry and updating is done via this screen.</p>

	<p>New ping servers are defined by typing the information into the table and then submitting it.</p>


	<h3>Server Name</h3>

		<p>A descriptive name for the server or service.  This name will appear in the weblog entry form where you choose whether to send a ping to this server.  This is a <strong>required</strong> field and may contain spaces.</p>


	<h3>Server URL/Path</h3>

		<p>The URL where the ping should be sent.  This information should be available from the service; it may be listed for "developers" or in a section about how to send a ping.  This is a <strong>required</strong> field and should be the full URL.  Example: <samp>http://rpc.weblogs.com/RPC2</samp></p>


	<h3>Port</h3>

		<p>This is the server port to which the ping should be sent.  HTTP is typically sent on port 80; you can change this if the ping service uses a different port.  This information should be available from the service; it may be listed for "developers" or in a section about how to send a ping.  This is a <strong>required</strong> field and should simply be the port number.</p>


	<h3>Protocol</h3>

		<p>What protocol should be used to send the ping.  Different ping servers accept the data in different protocols.  This information should be available from the service; it may be listed for "developers" or in a section about how to send a ping.  Currently, these protocols are supported:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>xmlrpc</b></li>
		</ul>


	<h3>Default</h3>

		<p>This setting determines whether or not you want the checkbox for this ping server to be checked by default.  If you choose "Yes" then the checkbox will be checked on the weblog new entry form.</p>


	<h3>Order</h3>

		<p>These settings determine the order in which the ping servers are displayed on the weblog new entry form.  "1" is listed first, "2" second, and so on.  Simply put the ping servers in the order you wish by placing the numbers appropriately in the boxes.</p>




	<h2>Deleting</h2>

	<p>Delete an existing ping server by removing the Server Name and then submitting the form.  Ping server deletion is permanent and irreversible, so <strong>be very careful before deleting a ping server</strong>.  There is <strong>no verification</strong> performed; once you submit the ping server is removed immediately.</p>
