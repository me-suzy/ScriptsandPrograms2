	<h1>Recount Statistics</h1>

	<p>This section of the Control Panel allows you to force the system to recount different types of statistics.  This section is rarely necessary, but every once in a while a statistic can become out of sync or otherwise not reflect the correct data.  This section will allow you to make the system update the information.</p>



	<h2><a name="main_screen">Main Screen</a></h2>

	<p>The main <dfn>Recount Statistics</dfn> screen shows a table of the statistics for which you can force a recount.  In addition, there is a <dfn><a href="#recount_preferences">Recount Preferences</a></dfn> link which leads to a page for specifying the preferences.</p>

	<p>This table shows the "Source" or type of data, the number of database records that exist for that Source, and a link to perform the recount action.  Clicking one of the links takes you to the <dfn><a href="#perform_recount">Perform Recount</a></dfn> screen.</p>



	<h2><a name="perform_recount">Perform Recount</a></h2>

	<p>This screen, which is available for access through the main <dfn>Recount Statistics</dfn> screen, allows you to actually initiate the recount of the data.</p>

	<img src="recount_statistics_perform_recount.gif" width="599" height="124" alt="Perform Recount main screen" title="Perform Recount main screen" />

	<p>It lists the total records to process, the number of records remaining (see <dfn>Recount Preferences</dfn> below for information about processing in batches), and a link to initiate the recount.</p>



	<h2><a name="recount_preferences">Recount Preferences</a></h2>

	<p>This screen is accessed through a link off of the main <dfn>Recount Statistics</dfn> screen.  It allows you to set preferences for the recounting.</p>

	<img src="recount_statistics_recount_preferences.gif" width="597" height="238" alt="Recount Preferences main screen" title="Recount Preferences main screen" />

	<p>Because the recounting of statistics can impose a large load on the server, the recounting is performed in batches.  On this screen you can define how large each processing batch will be.  For most servers, a value of 1000 works well.  For high-performance or dedicated servers you can increase this number and if your server is low on resources you can lower the number to something more manageable.
