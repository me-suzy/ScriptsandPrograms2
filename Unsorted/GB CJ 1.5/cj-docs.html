<h4>Blind Links</h4>
Blind Links is the main way to traffic exchange. Your site should have some blind-links for correct trade.
Blind link format: <b>go.php?link=anylinkname</b> . Give 'link' a different name for each link you need to track.
If you will use unique linkname for each link, then script will track what links people click on.
You can see clicked links statistic on your admin page. Click on button 'Logs' and then button 'Link Tracking' to check stats.<br>
Samples:<br>
<TEXTAREA ROWS=3 COLS=50>
<a href=go.php?link=1>Some Text</a>
<a href=go.php?link=music>Cool Music Here</a>
</TEXTAREA>

<h4>Permanent links</h4>
Permanent link is the link to one of traders, which will track hits to this trader.
Just add parameter ref=anymembername after go.php to permanent linking.
Sample: <b>go.php?ref=supersitecom&link=bestlink</b> for sending all hits from this link to memer with name 'supersitecom'.

<h4>Groups</h4>
Groups are needed for sending visitors to different categories of traders. Just add parameter group=groupname after go.php .
Sample: <b>go.php?group=mp3&link=coollink</b> for sending all hits from this link to memers of 'mp3' group only.
You can set up group name for each trader by editing his data.
Also you can create individual pages for groups. Just use page name as group name in taders datas.
Sample: if you set groupname 'mp3.html' for some trader, then all traffic from this trader will be redirected on page mp3.html.

<h4>Default trader auxout</h4>

When you click the link on your new site, you will be redirected on http://google.com.
This is default url to sending visitors that already have visited all your traders.
Replace this url by url of some your site or your sponsor by editing default trader auxout.

<h4>Adding new traders in database</h4>
Click the button 'Add' on admin page. Wabmasters also can add to you their sites from page webmasters.php .


<h4>Toplist of your traders</h4>
You can insert toplist code into template of main page.<br>
Sample toplist code:<br>
<TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=80>
1. <a href="go.php?link=top&ref={member1}">{desc1}</a> - {clicks1}<br><br>
2. <a href="go.php?link=top&ref={member2}">{desc2}</a> - {clicks2}<br><br>
3. <a href="go.php?link=top&ref={member3}">{desc3}</a> - {clicks3}<br><br>
4. <a href="go.php?link=top&ref={member4}">{desc4}</a> - {clicks4}<br><br>
</TEXTAREA>
<br><br>
Sites sorted by Clicks.
<br><br>
You can use predefined variabeles in template:<br>
{member#} - Site ID<br>
{clicks#} - Clicks for 24 hours<br>
{desc#} - Site Name for toplist<br>
<br>

<h4>Sending hits to content</h4>
Example: <b>go.php?url=http://www.somehost.com/freecontent.html&s=70&link=content</b> .
When a surfer clicks on this link, he will go to the content url (as stated in 'url=' parameter) by 70% chance,
and he will go to one of your trades by 30% chance. The order of parameters 'url=' ,'link=' and 's=' are not important,
just seperate them by an ampersand (&). s= and link= are optional. If s= is not in the url, the default chance is 50%.
Clicks to content will be counted as default trader 'direct'.

<h4>First click to content</h4>
It can increase your productivity a lot on most cases.
Example: <b>go.php?url=http://www.somehost.com/freecontent.html&link=gal&s=70&first=1</b> .
When a surfer clicks on this link, and if this is his first click on one of your go.php links on your site, he will go to the content url by 100% chance. On further clicks he will go by 70% chance.

<h4>TextLink-Thumb-Content Rotators</h4>
Rotator automatically defines the most popular links on your site and places them in the beginning of page.
You can rotate blind-links or links to content. To start rotator you need to create database with text links (or thumbs) and links to content(optional).
Just click the button 'Rotator' on the admin page and fill in two tables.
Right table can be blank, if you will create no-content rotator.
Also you can import automatically thumbs/content from any subdirectory on your server.
And then you need to add rotator in the main page tamplate.
<br>
Example: Thumb-rotator<br>
<TEXTAREA ROWS=6 COLS=80>
<table><tr>
<td><a href='<?rlink(1);?>'><img src='<?rdesc(1);?>'></a></td>
<td><a href='<?rlink(1);?>'><img src='<?rdesc(1);?>'></a></td>
<td><a href='<?rlink(1);?>'><img src='<?rdesc(1);?>'></a></td>
</tr></table>
</TEXTAREA>
<br>
Example: Text-link Rotator<br>
<TEXTAREA ROWS=4 COLS=80>
<a href='<?rlink(1);?>'><?rdesc(1);?></a><br>
<a href='<?rlink(1);?>'><?rdesc(1);?></a><br>
<a href='<?rlink(1);?>'><?rdesc(1);?></a><br>
</TEXTAREA>
