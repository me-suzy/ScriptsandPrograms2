Version History
===============

1.5.4: [Oct-07-2002]
   » Added support for Quicktime.
     New file: getid3.quicktime.php
   » Added support for AAC files, both ADTS and ADIF header formats.
     ADIF format is a pain because it's very similar to standard MP3
     header format, and it's hard to distinguish between the two. I
     have tried to make the detection accurate, but I have a limited
     number of AAC test files to play with so if you have an AAC file
     that gets detected as MP3/MP2 (or vice-versa), please send me
     the details via email at getid3@silisoftware.com
     ADTS format is very slow to parse because to get the bitrate of
     VBR files the whole file has to be stepped through frame by
     frame (getID3() scans up to the first 1000 frames and assumes
     that to be close enough).
     Note: I would suggest commenting out support for AAC (see top of
     GetAllMP3info() function in getid3.php) unless you need it.
     (thanks jfaul@gmx.de for the idea and sample Delphi source code)
     New file: getid3.aac.php
   » Added bitrate distribution analysis option for MP3 VBR files. A
     new boolean parameter for getOnlyMPEGaudioInfo() enabled this
     feature which steps through the MP3 file frame by frame and
     counts how many frames of each bitrate exist. This information
     is returned in ['mpeg']['audio']['bitrate_distribution']
     Caution: this feature is very inefficient for large files and
     takes a very long time and does lots of disk I/O. Use with care.
   Ø Changed layout of allowedFormats in GetAllMP3info() function in
     getid3.php to allow easy removal of support for any of the
     supported format. As stated above, I recommend commenting out
     AAC unless needed.
   Ø Added ['flac']['compressed_audio_bytes'],
     ['flac']['uncompressed_audio_bytes'], and
     ['flac']['compression_ratio']
   Ø Replaced FXPT2DOT30toFloat() function with FixedPoint2_30()
   * Bugfix: getid3.mpc.php was slightly miscalculating the number of
     samples, therefore also bitrate and playtime
     (thanks ah@artemis.dk for the fix)
   * Bugfix: MonkeyCompressionLevelNameLookup() didn't know about
     'insane' compression (thanks ah@artemis.dk for the fix)
   * Bugfix: MonkeySamplesPerFrame() was incorrect for MAC v3.95+
     (thanks ah@artemis.dk for the fix)
   * Bugfix: getid3.check.php wasn't processing the assumeFormat
     directive when (register_globals == off)
   * Bugfix: detecting of synch pattern for MP3 files with invalid
     data at the beginning wasn't always correct, also meant possible
     incorrect bitrate/duration/etc info for such corrupt files.
   getid3.functions.php now includes a replacement utf8_decode()
     function for those PHP installations that are not configured
     with the --with-xml option. (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)

1.5.3: [Sep-30-2002]
   » Added support for VQF. (thanks mt@mansonthomas.com for the idea)
     New file: getid3.vqf.php
   » Added support for FLAC. Comments, if present, are returned under
     ['ogg'] because they follow the Ogg Vorbis structure standard.
     New file: getid3.flac.php
   Ø OS/2-format bitmaps are now correctly interpreted. The format of
     the bitmap is now returned in ['bmp']['type_os'] and
     ['bmp']['type_version']. OS/2 bitmaps can be v1 or v2, Windows
     can be v1, v4 or v5

1.5.2: [Sep-25-2002]

   » Support for RealMedia (audio & video) added
     Note: only tested on G2 and v5 audio and video files - if anyone
     has older and/or newer sample files, please test it and/or send
     me the sample files.
     (thanks stephane@tekartists.com for idea)
     New file: getid3.real.php
   » Support for BMP added. Palette and pixel data can optionally be
     extracted as well - this is slow and generally unneccesary, but
     the option is there if you need it. Also includes PlotBMP()
     which will take the extracted pixel data and output it as a true
     color PNG. This function requires GD v2.0+
     Note: Untested on 16-bit and 32-bit BMPs because I couldn't find
     any sample files - if you know of a program that can create such
     files, please email getid3@silisoftware.com
     Note: Support for RGB (uncompressed), RLE8 and RLE4 is included
     and tested. BITFIELDS support is also included for 16- & 32-bit
     formats, but it's untested, so if anybody has any test files
     please send them to getid3@silisoftware.com
     Note: Support currently only for Windows-format BMPs, and trying
     to parse an OS/2-format bitmap leads to unpredictable/invalid
     results.
     New file: getid3.bmp.php
   » PNG now fully parsed, including all information chunks
     New file: getid3.png.php
   Ø Support for GIF/JPG/PNG moved to seperate files and expanded,
     including standard ['resolution_x'] and ['resolution_y'] as well
     as more thorough parsing of header information
     New file: getid3.gif.php
     New file: getid3.jpg.php
   table_var_dump() simplified and now outputs &#123;-style character
     entities for characters outside the normal alphanumeric range
   CleanOggCommentName() changed to a regular expression
     (thanks chris-getid3@bolt.cx for rewriting the function)

1.5.1: [Sep-20-2002]
   » Added support for MPEGplus/Musepack SV7. ['fileformat'] is 'SV7'
     for version 7 files (versions 4, 5 ,6 and 8 are not supported
     yet, but will be of ['fileformat'] SV4, SV5, SV6 and SV8) when
     they are supported (thanks Christian Fritz for the idea)
     New file: getid3.mpc.php
   Ø ['bitrate_audio'], ['bitrate_video'], ['bitrate_mode'],
     ['channels'], ['resolution_x'], and ['resolution_y'] keys added
     for all appropriate formats
   Ø Ogg files with a COVERART comment now save and display the
     attached image the same way as is done with ID3v2 APICs
   Ø ['ogg']['comments'][n]['data'] and
     ['ogg']['comments'][n]['dataoffset'] is now returned for all
     comments. ['ogg']['comments'][n]['data'] is only useful if
     the field is supposed to contain binary data. It is a
     base64_decode()'d version of ['value'].
     ['ogg']['comments'][n]['dataoffset'] is the byte offset in the
     file at which the 'COMMENTNAME=value string' starts, not the
     start of just 'value'
   Ø ['ogg']['comments'][n]['image_mime'] is now returned if
     ['ogg']['comments'][n]['data'] contains valid image data.
   Ø More than 3 Ogg pages may now be read in, if the comment data
     is longer than 1 page (usually about 4kB)
   Ø ['fileformat'] is now 'mp2' rather than 'mp3' if it's MPEG-1,
     Layer-II audio
   Ø ASF bitrates now calculated even if stream_bitrate_properties
     object not present
   Ø ['asf']['stream_properties_object'] is now a numeric-key array
     with one entry for each stream - the key being the stream number
   Ø ['replay_gain'] is returned for all audio formats that support
     it (MP3-LAME, ID3v2, Ogg) (thanks Christian Fritz for the idea)
   Ø ['mpeg']['audio']['LAME']['RGAD']['radio_replay_gain'] is now
     ['mpeg']['audio']['LAME']['RGAD']['radio'] (same for audiophile)
   Ø ASF/WMA files now use WM/Track to get track number from if
     WM/TrackNumber is not available (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)
   Ø ASF/WMV files now returns ['year'] and ['asf']['year']
   Ø ASV/WMV files now use ['content_description']['description'] for
     the ['comment'] field (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)
   Ø ['track'] is now always returned as an integer
   * Bugfix: Ogg comments that are larger than one data page (usually
     about 4kB) are now correctly parsed (thanks Christian Fritz)
   * Bugfix: Ogg comment data is now UTF8-decoded
   * Bugfix: Ogg comment writing now UTF8-encodes the data
   * Bugfix: playtime for ASF files was off by <preroll> (usually
     between 3 and 12 seconds)
   * Bugfix: ['asf']['stream_properties_objects']['flags'] data was
     possibly incorrect
   * Bugfix: ASF Padding Object was overwriting
     Stream Bitrate Properties Object data (now returned correctly in
     ['asf']['padding_object']
   * Bugfix: ASF Marker Object Reserved_2 field was incorrect
   * Bugfix: ASF Bitrate Mutual Exclusion Object had incorrect stream
     numbers
   Warning displayed if incorrectly-formatted Ogg comment is present
     (known to be an issue with CDex v1.40, but fixed by v1.50b7)
     (thanks Christian Fritz)
   Ogg comment writing now checks for valid comment names
   Added bitrate column in getid3.check.php, and added some formatting
     (font, colour)
   Performance tweaks using bitwise math instead of binary string
     operations

1.5.0: [Sep-18-2002]
   » Ogg comment writing support added. getid3.write.php has been
     updated to allow for writing comment tags to both MP3 and Ogg.
     Big thanks to Chris Bolt <chris-getid3@bolt.cx> for writing the
     OggWrite() function and offering it for inclusion in getID3()
     New file: getid3.ogginfo.php
   » Support for Monkey's Audio and APE tag added.
     (thanks Christian Fritz for the idea)
     New file: getid3.ape.php
     ['fileformat'] now returns 'mac' for Monkey's Audio files, or
     'ape' for files with an APE tag (Monkey's Audio or other format)
   » getid3.thumbnail.php has been removed from the distribution and
     the table_var_dump() function now outputs APICs as seperate
     files in the same directory as the analyzed file. This should
     make the image-displaying more reliable as well as reduce
     complexity. The naming convention for the images is
     filename.ext.[byte offset of APIC data].[jpg|gif|png]
     If anybody still has any problems with corrupted images please
     let me know at getid3@silisoftware.com
   » Support for extended Xing/LAME tag
     (see http://users.belgacom.net/gc247244/extra/tag.html)
     Data is returned in ['mpeg']['audio']['LAME']
   Ø ['ogg']['tracknumber'] has been renamed to ['ogg']['track'] and
     ['track'] is now returned in the root of the array
   Ø ['ogg']['pageheader'][n]['flag'] has been renamed to
     ['ogg']['pageheader'][n]['flags'] and the unprocessed flag byte
     is available in ['ogg']['pageheader'][n]['flags_raw']
   Ø ['frequency'] is now returned for WAVE files in the root of the
     array (thanks daniel@electroteque.org)
   Ø ASF files now return codec, bitrate, resolution, etc information
     under ['asf']['video_media'] or ['asf']['audio_media']
   * Bugfix: RVA2 and EQU2 writing in getid3.putid3.php were
     incorrectly writing Volume Adjustment field
   * Bugfix: EQU2 in getid3.frames.php was reading Volume Adjustment
     as unsigned integer instead of signed integer
   * Bugfix: handling of remote files over HTTP & FTP was broken
     (thanks Vince)
   * Bugfix: incorrect handling of some ASF packets
   ASF/Windows Media format now more fully parsed, including Index
     Objects
   Added several new fourCC video codecs


1.4.3: [Sep-15-2002]
   » Now parses ASF / WMV / WMA files
   Ø New file: getid3.asf.php
   * Bugfix: RoughTranslateUnicodeToASCII() would return nothing
     if didn't find a terminator it was expecting
   Added FILETIMEtoUNIXtime() function (for converting 64-bit
     Microsoft FILETIME timestamps, used in ASF files and elsewhere,
     to UNIX Epoch timestamps)
   Added GUIDtoBytestring() and BytestringToGUID() functions

1.4.2: [Sep-12-2002]
   » getID3() now requires PHP v4.1.0 or higher because it now is
     designed to work with register_globals = off and the new auto-
     globals ($_GET, $_SERVER, etc).
   * Bugfix: VBR MP3 files with Fraunhofer-style VBR header were not
     being correctly detected in most cases
     (thanks dkushner@oddcast.com and mike@ftl.com for sample files)
   * Bugfix: IsValidTextEncoding() was broken
   * Bugfix: Add stripslashes($EditorFilename) to getid3.write.php
     (writing was broken for files with ' or " in the filename)
     (thanks mike@ftl.com and kthejoker)
   * Bugfix: If there is garbage data between a valid VBR header
     frame and a sequence of valid MPEG-audio frames the VBR data is
     no longer discarded. (thanks to mike@ftl.com for sample
     Fraunhofer-style VBR file produced with MusicMatch v7.2)
   Ø Changed variable system to work with (register_globals = off)
   Ø Moved relevant code into seperate PlaytimeString() function
   Ø Added nl2br() to table_var_dump() for cleaner output
   Ø Now returns the following keys from Fraunhofer-VBR files:
     ['VBR_seek_offsets'], ['VBR_seek_offsets_stride'],
     ['VBR_offsets_relative'] and ['VBR_offsets_absolute']
   Ø Added ID3v1matchesID3v2() function and implemented in
     getid3.check.php (thanks to "Guest" in the forums for the idea)
   Changed amount of data read in getid3.getimagesize.php from 10kB
     to entire file. (thanks mike@ftl.com)
   Wrapped function_exists() checks around function definitions in
     getid3.functions.php
   Fixed a lot of E_WARNING and E_NOTICE situations, especially in
     ID3-writing code (getid3.putid3.php, etc)
   Added checks to make sure all needed data is available for writing
     ID3v2 tags

1.4.1b5: [May-30-2002]
   * Bugfix: Unsynchronise() was broken, now fixed
     (thanks mike@ftl.com)
   * Bugfix: GenerateID3v2Tag() now correctly uses non-synchsafe
     integers for frame size descriptors in ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.2
     (thanks mike@ftl.com)
   Ø Added ['artist'], ['title'], etc keys to root of returned
     array to provide a common place to access any returned info
     from any file type. Currently gets info from ID3v1, ID3v2,
     Ogg, and RIFF/WAVE. Possible returned keys are:
     title, artist, album, year, genre, comment, track
   Ø Modified LookupGenre() function to search for either genre based
     on numeric ID, or now reverse lookup as well
   Ø Added ['artist'], ['title'], etc keys to ['RIFF'] information
     if info tags are present
   Added functionality to attach a picture to the ID3v2 tag in
     getid3.write.php
   Sorted genres into alphabetical order (special 3 at end of list)
     in getid3.write.php
   Changed the comment-edit field in getid3.write.php to a multi-line
     <textarea> from a single-line <input>
   getid3.write.php now only writes ID3v2 frames that have data
   Added default TXXX field to getid3.write.php to put a tagger info
     field when writing ID3v2 tags. Description is "ID3v2-tagged by"
     and data is "getID3() v[version] (www.silisoftware.com)"
   Changed getid3.check.php to use the new common info keys
   Improved file-format detection in getid3.check.php - if the auto-
     detect based on the first few bytes of the file doesn't find a
     known format (for example if the header is corrupt), a more
     thorough scan is done based on the file extension
   Added 'Edit ID3' link from getid3.check.php to getid3.write.php for
     MP3 files  (thanks max@gutalin.com for the idea)
   Added 'Delete file' link from getid3.check.php to getid3.write.php
     allowing you to permanently delete a file (be careful with this!!)
     (thanks max@gutalin.com for the idea)
   Added some mouse-over titles for links in getid3.check.php

1.4.1b4: [May-15-2002]
   * Bugfix: getid3.check.php wasn't parsing MP3s with invalid headers
     or padding at the beginning of the file - added 'assumeFormat'
     parameter and 'Parse this file as:' options to force parsing in a
     particular format  (thanks Alcohol for the sample file)
   * Bugfix: unset(['fileformat']) and ['error'] added in cases where
     file cannot be parsed in the assumed or forced format

1.4.1b3: [May-01-2002]
   Ø For Ogg files, now calculates the real average bitrate (returned
     in ['ogg']['bitrate_average']) and so the playtime of the file is
     calculated on actual average bitrate, not nominal bitrate, so it
     should be accurate now  (thanks to stephane@tekartists.com for
     telling me it was wrong)
   * Bugfix: ID3v2FrameIsAllowed() wasn't behaving properly if the
     writing functions were called for more than one file, because of
     the static array not being cleared between uses. This is an
     updated fix because the one in 1.4.1b2 didn't work :o)
     (thanks soulcatcher@evilsoft.org and yoyo)
   Added rawurlencode() to the filename parameter in table_var_dump()
     for images (wouldn't work with path/file names containing special
     characters (#, &, ", +)  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   getid3.check.php no longer attempts to scan all MIDI tracks in
     directory-browse mode, since this can take a long time. Detailed
     single-file view is still fully scanned (new third parameter for
     getMIDIHeaderFilepointer() controls this)
   Small improvements to MoreNaturalSort()

1.4.1b2: [April-18-2002]
   Ø GetAllMP3Info()'s 2nd parameter has changed from boolean to string
     (now specifying the parse-this-file-as-this format, like 'mp3',
     but also can be FALSE to mean don't assume any format, auto-detect
     only), and a third parameter (array containing allowed formats)
     has been added. The assumedFormat parameter allows a file to be
     forced to be parsed as a certain format rather than relying on the
     auto-detection of getID3() (ex: an MP3 wrapped in a RIFF/WAV
     header will be auto-detected as RIFF/WAV, but if forced to parse
     as MP3 will extract the original MP3 information)
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net)
   * Bugfix: ID3v2FrameIsAllowed() wasn't behaving properly if the
     writing functions were called for more than one file, because of
     the static array not being cleared between uses (thanks yoyo)
   * Bugfix: Lyrics3 data wasn't being properly copied from the ['raw']
     keys to the easy keys (['title'], etc.)  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   * Bugfix: some testing code was accidentally left in
     getid3.thumbnail.php  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   * Bugfix: RIFF/WAVE files are now more likely to have all their
     chunks parsed.
   * Bugfix: RIFF/WAVE bitrate & playtime now better calculated
   * Bugfix: MP3 scanning for synch doesn't go beyond 64k now, to stop
     intensive scanning through large file that don't have a synch
     (thanks soulcatcher@evilsoft.org for a weird sample file)
   Improved performance when scanning for MP3 synch (about 600% faster
     if the synch is never found)
   ZIP files no longer return the contents of each compressed file, as
     that would very easily be more data than PHP could handle.
     (thanks davidbullock@tech-center.com)
   getid3.check.php now displays entries in a more natural sort order:
     case insensitive, ignores most punctuation, treats accented chars
     the same as their unaccent equivalent  (thanks mike@ftl.com)
   Added support for SmartSound-format RIFF files (which are regular
     RIFF/WAVE files with the first 4 chars changed from RIFF to SDSS)
   All instances of while(list() = each()) replaced with foreach()
   Not a major change, but www.getid3.tk now points to
     www.silisoftware.com

1.4.1b1: [April-11-2002]
   » Parses MIDI files.
     NOTE: very slow at parsing, much slower than any other file type
     NOTE: playtime is generally mostly accurate, but not always 100%
   » Parses ZIP files (if ZZIPlib available, and only in PHP 4.0.7RC1
     and later (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.zip.php)
     NOTE: currently untested as I'm unable to find php_zip.dll for
     PHP/Win32 - if someone has a copy of this file, please email me:
     getid3@silisoftware.com
   » Parses JPEG files (requires GD installed)
   » Parses PNG files  (requires GD v1.6+ installed)
   » Parses GIF files  (requires GD < v1.6 installed)
   » For MP3s, once a valid synch is detected, the next 5 frames are
     also scanned for valid synch signatures, to prevent false
     identification of synch. For corrupt MP3 files this will be a bit
     slower, but hopefully produce more reliable results.
     (Thanks to mpdj@btinternet.com for bringing this to my attention,
     and xbhoff@pacbell.net for explaining what was happening)
     (Thanks also to macik for helping me with MP3 frame lengths:
     http://66.96.216.160/cgi-bin/YaBB.pl
     ?board=c&action=display&num=1018474068)
   » The actual image data is now displayed (for JPEG, PNG and GIF
     images only) rather than a binary text dump in getid3.check.php
     (specifically table_var_dump()) for APIC frames. Made possible
     by the inclusion of (a modified version of) GetURLImageSize() by
     Filipe Laborde-Basto (www.rezox.com). You can right-click, save-as
     to extract the image to a file.
     NOTE: The actual image data is still returned in ['data']
   Ø ['image_mime'], ['image_width'], ['image_height'], ['image_bytes']
     are now returned for APICs
   Ø split parsing functions out into seperate files: lyrics3, id3v1,
     id3v2, mp3, ogg, riff, mpeg, midi, zip
   Ø ['ogg']['bitrate_ave'] -> ['ogg']['bitrate_nominal'] (thanks to
     stephane@tekartists.com for pointing out that "nominal" bitrate
     may actually differ significantly from the "average" bitrate)
     The real average bitrate seems to be only extractable by parsing
     the entire file and calculating the average bitrate. This is not
     yet an option, but hopefully in a future version of getID3()
   Ø ['filename'] now returned for all files
   Ø ['ogg']['date'] and ['ogg']['description'] now returned when
     available  (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)
   Ø ['mpeg']['audio']['crc'] now contains the CRC (if present)
   Ø ['bitrate'] is now returned as a double instead of an int
   Ø ['dataoffset'] is now returned for all ID3v2 frames
   * Bugfix: MP3 CRC presence ['mpeg']['audio']['protection'] was being
     reported as opposite of what it actually should be
   * Bugfix: MPEG videos weren't being detected (they were being
     parsed as MP3), and even if they were, there was a typo in
     getMPEGHeaderFilepointer()  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   * Bugfix: getid3.functions.php wasn't being included in
     getid3.write.php  (thanks mike@ftl.com)
   * Bugfix: Browse:___ directory name in getid3.check.php wasn't
     correct with directory names with ' and other strange characters
     (thanks Christian Fritz)
   ID3v2FrameProcessing() now checks to see if the next frame is valid
     after it encounters an invalid FrameID, and if the next frameID
     appears valid, it will just skip the current (invalid) frame and
     continue processing (it would previously abort at the first sign
     of incorrect structure)   (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)
   getid3.check.php now scans filetypes based on content, not filename
     extension, and shows the filetype in the displayed output. Files
     are only scanned as MP3 if ID3v2 or MPEG-audio signatures are at
     the immediate beginning of the file (MP3 used to be the default
     format), so a corrupt file may not show up as MP3 format in the
     browse screen, but in detail it will scan in-depth
   getid3.check.php now has columns to show the presence of ID3v1,
     ID3v2 and Lyrics3 content
   Helium2 (www.helium2.com) has been known to write ID3v2.4 tags with
     non-synchsafe-integer framesizes, getID3() now checks for this and
     will override and parse the tag as ID3v2.3 if the tag would parse
     fine as ID3v2.3 when it's really specified as ID3v2.4  (thanks
     Christian Fritz for the test files)

1.4.0b9: [April-05-2002]
   » Ogg files now return bitrate and playtime (playtime calculated
     from nominal bitrate and filesize, so it's only approximately
     accurate).  (thanks stephane@tekartists.com for the idea)
   * Bugfix: ID3v1 tags were not properly being parsed - track, genre
     and comment fields were incorrect.  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   * Bugfix: getid3.check.php would not browse directories with single
     quotes (') or double quotes (") in the directory name.
     (thanks Christian Fritz)
   * Bugfix: Improved detection of MPEG-video files (a sample MP3 file
     had a false MPEG video signature at the beginning), and the MPEG-
     video parsing function now only looks for the MPEG-video header
     in the first 100k bytes of the file, to prevent needlessly
     scanning very large files. Also will not infinitely loop if it
     does not find what it's looking for.  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   ['error'] now returned if MP3 synch doesn't occur at beginning of
     file if ID3v2 not used (ie there's some kind of padding there that
     should not be)
   Reduced use of fread() in getMPEGHeaderFilepointer() (now faster)
   Added "file parsed in x.xxx seconds" to getid3.check.php
   Added "browse: <directory>" link to getid3.check.php
   Changed default ID3v2 majorversion from 2.4 to 2.3 in
     getid3.write.php because Winamp (and probably many other
     ID3v2-aware tools) can only read up to ID3v2.3
     (thanks mike@ftl.com)

1.4.0b8: [April-04-2002]
   » Lyrics3 support added  (thanks Christian Fritz for the idea)
   Ø check.php renamed to getid3.check.php
   Ø write.php renamed to getid3.write.php
   Ø ['id3']['id3v2']['error'] (if present) now reported in ['error']
   Ø ['mpeg']['audio']['error'] (if present) now reported in ['error']
   * Bugfix: RoughTranslateUnicodeToASCII() was completely mangling
     UTF-16/UTF-16BE encoded text
   * Bugfix: The warning about MP3ext wasn't always showing up
     (thanks davidbullock@tech-center.com)
   getID3v1Filepointer() cleaned up & shortened
   Moved the include_once() statements around so that a minimum of code
     is included

1.4.0b7: [April-03-2002]
   » RIFFs (specifically AVIs) are now more completely parsed,
     almost everything in the returned ['RIFF'] array has been moved
     around and/or restructured. A lot of new data is in there too -
     codecs, frame size, etc.
   Ø Better recursive parsing of RIFFs (sub-arrays are now in the right
     place)
   * Bugfix: the isset() idea introduced in beta 5 was incorrectly
     implemented, such that ['asciidata'] and ['asciidescription'] were
     never returned - this had the side effect that ID3v2 comments were
     not copied to ['id3']['id3v2']['comment']  (thanks mike@ftl.com)
   * Bugfix: MPEG audio synch wasn't being detected, and therefore MPEG
     audio data not parsed, if no ID3v2 header present in an MP3
   ID3v1 track number only returned if greater than zero
   Removed !== FALSE (introduced in 1.4.0b6) from while(fread()) loops,
     some users were reporting problems with that syntax.
   Changed substr($string, 0, 1) to $string{0} syntax in most files
   Reformatted getid3.changelog.txt to 72-column width

1.4.0b6: [April-01-2002]
   * Bugfix: 1.4.0b5 introduced a bug where any RIFF file other than
     PCM WAVE (this includes any compressed WAV, as well as all AVIs)
     would crash getID3()
   Reduced use of fread() in getOggHeaderFilepointer() for increased
     speed
   Added constant FREAD_BUFFER_SIZE for many fread() operations
   Added !== FALSE check to while(fread()) loops
     (thanks davidbullock@tech-center.com)
   Added more entries to RIFFwFormatTagLookup()
     (still looking for a good complete list)
   Converted use of hexdec() in getid3.lookup.php to 0x1234 notation

1.4.0b5: [March-28-2002]
   Ø Renamed decodeheader() to decodeMPEGaudioHeader()
   * Bugfix: Fixed infinite loop problem for RIFF/WAV files with
     unknown chunks
   * Bugfix: WXXX frames were incorrectly writing from ['URL'] instead
     of ['url']
   * Bugfix: RoughTranslateUnicodeToASCII() wasn't properly decoding
     UTF-16/UTF-16BE
   Changed all quoted strings from " to ' to hopefully improve speed
     (although benchmarks have not yet shown any significant
     improvement in speed)  (thanks davidbullock@tech-center.com)
   Improved code in check.php for dealing with symbolic links
     (thanks davidbullock@tech-center.com)
   Changed '<?' tags to '<?php'  (thanks davidbullock@tech-center.com)
   Added processing time indicator in check.php
     (ie 'directory scanned in 2.45 seconds')
   Replaced all instances of feof() to prevent infinite loop conditions
   Moved lookup portions of decodeMPEGaudioHeader() to
     getid3.lookup.php
   Replaced $arrayname[$index] with $arrayname["$index"] to avoid PHP
     E_NOTICEs  (thanks davidbullock@tech-center.com)
   Wrapped isset() around many if statements, to avoid PHP E_NOTICEs,
     hence improve speed (up to 30x speed improvement reported in some
     cases :)

1.4.0b4: [March-26-2002]
   Ø RIFF/WAV file format now parsed, returned under ['riff']
   Ø Support for Relative Gain Adjustment in RIFF/WAV files
   Ø ['channels'] (1 or 2) now returned for MP3 and WAV files
   Ø ['bitrate'] now returned (in bits-per-second) at root level for
     MP3 and WAV files
   Added support for RGAD (Relative Gain ADjustment) ID3v2 frames, both
     reading & writing
     (see http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~djmrob/replaygain/ for details
     on RGAD)  (thanks Christian Fritz for the idea)
   Removed some test data-dumping from the ID3v2 writing functions
   Language code 'XXX' now returns descriptive string 'unknown' instead
     of NULL
   Seperated out comments from top of getid3.php into getid3.readme.txt
     and getid3.changelog.txt
   Split out non-lookup functions from getid3.lookup.php to
     getid3.functions.php

1.4.0b3: [March-25-2002]
   Ø ['asciidata'] for WXXX frames now returns correct information, but
     under ['asciidescription']  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   Ø Added ['framenamelong'] to all returned frame data arrays with
     text description of that frame (ie 'RVA2' would return 'Relative
     volume adjustment (2)')  (thanks Christian Fritz)
   Ø ['datalength'] is now ['indexeddatalength'] in ASPI frames (was
     confliciting with the all-frames ['datalength'] as introduced in
     v1.4.0b1
   Ø ['datalength'] now returned as integer (rather than double) where
     possible

1.4.0b2: [March-21-2002]
   Ø ['mpeg']['audio']['bitrate'] now returned as int rather than
     double for VBR files
   * Bugfix: MPEG audio information wasn't being parsed on files that
     had neither ID3v1 or ID3v2
   * Bugfix: COMM/WXXX frames weren't returning 'asciidata' in
     ID3v2.2, which also meant the ['id3']['id3v2']['comment'] field
     wasn't being returned  (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)
   * Bugfix: file might not be found if filename actually contains
     escaped chars or %xx-formatted characters
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net)
   Added support for running with Register Globals turned off
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net)
   Added urlencode() where needed in check.php
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net)

   » ID3v2 writing support via WriteID3v2() in putid3.php
     RemoveID3v2() and RemoveID3v1() functions now available in
     putid3.php  All ID3v1 and ID3v2 writing functions have been moved
     to putid3.php and example file write.php has been added to the
     distribution
   Ø MPEG audio frame information (bitrate, frequency, etc) now
     returned inside ['mpeg']['audio'] instead of just ['mpeg']
   Ø MPEG video information now parsed, returned in ['mpeg']['video']
     Note: audio portion of video system files is not yet being parsed
   Ø All flag bits are now returned as boolean rather than int or
     string
   Ø RVA2 data now returned as an array (multiple RVA2 tags are
     allowed)
   Ø RVA2/EQU2 description returned under ['description'] rather than
     ['identification']
   Ø RVAD/EQUA adjustments now returned as signed integers, rather than
     absolute values which required you to check flag bytes
   Ø RVRB/REV data no longer returns under ['reverb'] array
   Ø WXXX/W???/LINK frames now return ['url'] instead of ['URL']
   Ø USER now properly returns both ['language'] and ['languagename']

   Ø ['headerlength'] now includes the initial 6 or 10 bytes of the
     ID3v2 header
   Ø ['artist'], ['title'], ['album'], ['tracknumber'], ['genre'] now

   Ø added ['datalength'] to all ID3v2 frames: length of frame data,
     not including frame header
   Ø ['fileformat'] now returns 'id3' if there are ID3v1 or ID3v2 tags
     but no audio data
   Ø ['fileformat'] now returns 'mpg' if it's an MPEG system (video +

   * Bugfix: ['filename'] now properly returned for 'GEOB' frames
   * Bugfix: ['imagetype'] now properly returned for 'PIC' frames in
     ID3v2.2
   * Bugfix: Genre not being written if not set in WriteID3v1()
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net)
   * Bugfix: Changed write mode to 'r+b' from 'a+' because ID3v1 tags
     were being appended instead of overwritten if they already existed
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net)
   * Bugfix: open would fail on filenames containing quotes
     (thanks javier@crackdealer.com)

     need any ID3 parsing  (thanks djpretzel@cox.rr.com for idea)
   Reduced use of fread() for increased performance in
     getID3v1Filepointer()
   Added clearstatcache() before checking filesize - size after writing
     tag now correct
   Added hack for mp3Rage (www.chaoticsoftware.com) that puts
     ID3v2.3-formatted MIME type instead of 3-char ID3v2.2-format image
     type  (thanks xbhoff@pacbell.net for test file)

1.3.2: [February-15-2002]
   Ø UFID/UFI, USLT/ULT, COMM/COM, APIC/PIC, GEOB/GEO, CRM, RVA2, EQU2,
     POPM/POP, AENC/CRA, ENCR and GRID frame data now returned under
     numeric array index rather than by ownerID
   Ø RVA2 frame data is now returned keyed by $channeltypeid instead of
     $frame_idstring
   Ø WXXX/WXX frame description now returned under ['description']
     instead of ['data']
   Trailing null bytes now trimmed from frame (W??? & T???) text data
     (it shouldn't be there to begin with, but a sample file encoded by
     [unknown program] had data padded to 50 chars with null bytes,
     which caused ParseID3v2GenreString() to freeze).

1.3.1: [February-13-2002]
   * Bugfix: ['playtime_seconds'] and ['playtime_string'] were not
     being returned
   * Bugfix: ['fileformat'] was incorrectly being returned as a
     2-element array

   Improved RoughTranslateUnicodeToASCII()
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net for Unicode test file)

1.3.0: [February-13-2002]
   » ID3v1 writing support via WriteID3v1()
   Ø MPEG audio frame information (bitrate, frequency, etc) now
     returned inside ['mpeg']
   Ø ['mpeg']['raw'] returns the integer values of the bits for MPEG
     audio information as returned in ['mpeg'] by decodeheader()
     (thanks reel_taz@users.sourceforge.net)
   Ø 'protection', 'padding', 'private', 'copyright' and 'original' now
     return as boolean
   Ø 'bitrate' and 'frequency' now return as int (except in special
     case of 'free')
   Language name as well as code retured where appropriate
     (ie 'English' and 'eng')
   Text frames with invalid TextEncoding value are now passed through
     anyway
   ID3v1 data (title, artist, album, year, comment) is now trimmed
     (no more nulls)
   RoughTranslateUnicodeToASCII() now uses utf8_decode() for UTF-8

1.2.5: [January-30-2002]
   * Bugfix: Playtime calculations for VBR files were off slightly
     (rounding error)
   * Bugfix: Extended header length was incorrectly calculated
   * Bugfix: Genre strings such as '03' weren't being handled correctly
   More complete support for ID3v2.3 FrameIDs
   Split out getid3.frames.php (FrameID-specific parsing function)
   Split out getid3.lookup.php (assorted lookup-table functions)
   Searches for what directory getid3.*.php support files are in (must
     be same as getid3.php, but doesn't have to be same as main file -
     for example your main file could be /index.php, but including
     /lib/getid3/getid3.php)
   Simplified, tweaked, changed and/or eliminated several functions.

1.2.4: [January-26-2002]
   » Basic support for reading Ogg-Vorbis comment tags

1.2.3: [January-24-2002]
   » ID3v2.2.x 3-char FrameIDs are now fully parsed
     Note: While I've included support for 22 FrameIDs as defined in
     the specs, I don't have test files for all of them. If anyone
     knows of programs that generate any of the untested tags, please
     email getid3@silisoftware.com ! Here's what's tested and not:
       Tested: T??, COM
     Untested: UFI, TXX, W??, WXX, IPL, MCI, ETC, MLL, STC, ULT, SLT,
               RVA, EQU, REV, PIC, GEO, CNT, POP, BUF, CRM, CRA, LNK
   table_var_dump() now displays boolean variables as TRUE or FALSE
   table_var_dump() now uses htmlspecialchars() to avoid broken-table
     problems

1.2.2: [January-18-2002]
   Ø Parses ID3v2 genres into ['id3v2']['genreid'] and
     ['id3v2']['genrelist'] where appropriate
     (thanks stephane@tekartists.com for the idea)
   Added ID3v2 genre abbreviations 'RX' (remix) and 'CR' (cover)

1.2.1: [January-17-2002]
   * Bugfix: 'mp3' was being returned in ['format'], but 'zip' was
     being returned in ['fileformat'], both are now returned in
     ['fileformat']
   Ø Splits ['id3v2']['track'] in the format '5/12' into
     ['track'] = '5' and ['totaltracks'] = '12'
   Ø Enabled ['id3v2']['title'] etc for ID3v2.2.x (3-char frame names)
     (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)
   Ø Changed v1.?? version number format to v1.?.?
   Scans through the file until it finds the MPEG synch (start of audio
     frame) - some files encoded by LAME 3.91 had undocumented padding
     after the ID3v2 header; getMP3headerFilepointer() now scans until
     it finds synch (or EOF)  (thanks adam@trekjapan.com)
   Improved Unicode conversion in RoughTranslateUnicodeToASCII()

1.20:  [January-15-2002]
   » Support for variable-bitrate (VBR) files, both Xing and Fraunhofer
     headers
   » All 4-character FrameIDs are now fully parsed according to the
     specs at http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames.txt
     Ø This means that most no longer return ['flags'] and ['data']
     Note: While I've included support for 30 FrameIDs as defined in
     the specs, I don't have test files for all of them. If anyone
     knows of programs that generate any of the untested tags, please
     email getid3@silisoftware.com ! Here's what's tested and not:
       Tested: UFID, T???, WXXX, USLT, SYLT, COMM, APIC, GEOB
     Untested: TXXX, W???, MCDI, ETCO, MLLT, SYTC, RVA2, EQU2, RVRB,
               PCNT, POPM, RBUF, AENC, USER, OWNE, COMR, ENCR, GRID,
               PRIV, SIGN, SEEK, ASPI
   Ø Added 'title', 'artist', etc names to ID3v2 data (easier to access
     than the 4-character FrameIDs of the ID3v2 standard)
     (thanks jakson@gmx.net)
   * Bugfix: added fclose() at end of GetAllMP3Info()
     (thanks stephane@tekartists.com)
   * Bugfix: ID3v1 wasn't being parsed if ID3v2 wasn't present
     (thanks jakson@gmx.net)
   * Bugfix: several flags were being parsed incorrectly (the structure
     had changed from ID3v2.3 to ID3v2.4) - v2.3 flags were being
     incorrectly parsed
   Much more compact implementation of decodeheader()
     (thanks jakson@gmx.net for the idea)
   ID3v1 genres 126 through 147  (thanks jakson@gmx.net)
   New table_var_dump() function in check.php
     (based partially on idea by jakson@gmx.net)
   Seperated ID3v1 retrieval into seperate function

1.11:  [December-23-2001]
   All functions merged into file getid3.php
   Updated documentation to reflect new returned information

   * Bugfix: ID3v1 Track# was incorrectly being parsed whether it
     existed or not
   Changed calling procedure to recommend using
     GetAllMP3info($filename) from getmp3header.php
   Now includes check.php - example file
   Ø Checks to see if file is in ZIP or MP3 format
     (returned in ['format'])
     [Ed. Note: ['fileformat'] as of v1.2.1]

1.06:  [November-05-2001]
   * Bugfix: ID3v2.2.x frames weren't being parsed since they use
     6-byte rather than 10-byte headers as v2.3+ does
     (thanks spunk@mac.com for pointing that out)

1.05:  [September-06-2001]
   * Bugfix: ID3v2 was being parsed even if it didn't exist

1.04:  [July-16-2001]
   * Bugfix: typo in Extended Header section (strpad() should be
     str_pad()) (thanks jurroon@yahoo.com)

1.03:  [May-07-2001]
   * Bugfix: Added missing ['id3v1']['genreid'] and ['id3v1']['genre']

1.02:  [May-05-2001]
   Ø Added ['getID3version']

1.01:  [May-04-2001]
   » Added support for frame-level de-unsynchronisation (as per
     ID3v2.4.0 specs) in addition to ID3v2.3.x tag-level
     de-unsynchronisation

 Known Bugs/Issues in getID3()
 -----------------------------

  * APICs added with getID3() do not show up correctly in Windows
    Media Player (mike@delusion.org)
  * AVI streams aren't always quite being parsed 100% correctly
  * MIDI parsing is *very* slow
  * MIDI playtime is sometime inaccurate


 Known Bugs/Issues in other programs
 -----------------------------------

  * Winamp (up to v2.80 at least) does not support ID3v2.4 tags,
      only ID3v2.3
      see: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=387524
  * Some versions of Helium2 (www.helium2.com) do not write
      ID3v2.4-compliant Frame Sizes, even though the tag is marked
      as ID3v2.4)  (detected by getID3())
  * MP3ext V3.3.17(unicode) places a non-compliant padding string at
      the end of the ID3v2 header. This is supposedly fixed in
      v3.4b21 but only if you manually add a registry key. This fix
      is not yet confirmed.  (detected by getID3())
  * CDex v1.40 (fixed by v1.50b7) writes non-compliant Ogg comment
      strings, supposed to be in the format "NAME=value" but actually
      written just "value"  (detected by getID3())
