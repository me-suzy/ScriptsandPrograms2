            NETJUKE INSTALLER: Software Installation Tool
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Netjuke Installer is an Open Source tool that allows you to install
or upgrade the Netjuke Audio Streaming Jukebox. This tool automatically
generates the required database for the targeted copy of the software,
and provides the content of the vital preference file that will unlock
the application. There are protections built into the Netjuke so that a
live/installed copy cannot be compromised by a local or remote user.

The server-side components are powered by PHP 4, and an increasing choice
of databases. The interface is Web-based and can be accessed through a
Javascript & Cookies enabled browser.
