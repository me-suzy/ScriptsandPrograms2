        NETJUKE: Yet Another Web-Based Audio Streaming Jukebox
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Artekopia Netjuke is a Web-Based Audio Streaming Jukebox powered
by PHP 4, an increasing choice of databases and all the MP3, Ogg Vorbis,
Windows media Audio and other format files that constitute your digital
music collection. The Netjuke aims at enabling families and small
organizations or communities to run a private "mp3.com-like" Web site to
access the music they legitimately own, distribute or are granted access to.

Supports language packs (English, French, Catalan, German, Spanish),
multi-level security, shared and private playlists, random playlists,
images, etc.

Product Features:

- Cross-platform and lightweight interface: MSIE, Mozilla, Netscape,
  Konqueror, Galeon, etc.

- Features an easy to use browser-based install/upgrade tool to get
  you started in minutes.

- Escapes the filesystem metaphor for music categorization (ie:
  browsing through files and directories).

- Multi-database backend: MySQL, PostgreSQL (Oracle, MSSQL, Access &
  more to come soon). This feature is made possible by the Open Source
  PHP library ADODB.
  Web Site: http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB/

- Recursively scans named directories for audio files (mp3, ogg & wma),
  and imports them to the database in a snap. This feature is made possible
  by the Open Source PHP library getid3.php.
  Web Site: http://getid3.sourceforge.net/.

- Optimized for local MP3, OGG and WMA audio content, but also supports
  internet radio streams, other audio formats, and/or remote content by
  adding them manually.

- Quick search and advanced search options.

- Random Music Selector with filters to generate playlists.

- Music is indexed and cross-linked by artists, albums and genres.

- Features alphabetical artist and album listings, latest additions,
  search filters, most popular tracks, etc.

- User-editable private and or shared audio streaming playlists.

- Multiple built-in user access levels: Admin, Editors & Users.

- Security modes: public and/or private content, activate/disable
  public registration, etc.

- Optional Community section can be dynamically enabled or disabled
  from the admin section.

- Language pack support: English, French, Catalan, German, Spanish (...)

- Streaming can be achieved through multiple protocols, with
  appropriate audio player (http, https, rtsp, etc.).

- Supports streaming from any local or mounted directory (smb, nfs,
  etc.). Now also support a limited "Radio" option as of 1.0b9.

- URL of the streamed audio files can optionally be obfuscated for
  further protection against illegitimate or unwanted file downloads.

- Administrators can choose to limit music playback to the RealPlayer,
  which doesn't display any file URL, therefore protecting your media
  files even more.

- Administrators can optionally choose to allow for file download in
  addition to streaming. Public file trading IS NOT the intent of the
  author(s). Please be responsible, and get your music legally.

- Interface can be customized, and/or branded, using built-in color and
  font management tools, optional static or dynamic HTML header and
  footer (local or remote), etc.

- Administrator can choose to optionally let users customize their own
  color and font theme.

- The application, database and music streaming servers can reside on a
  single host, or separately.

- And much, much more!
