                    NETJUKE: Software Upgrade Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   IMPORTANT NOTE TO EXISTING USERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Upgrading to 1.0b16 (from 1.0b12 through 1.0b15.2)

This upgrade procedure is compatible with versions 1.0b12 to 1.0b15.2.

This version is only compatible with PHP 4.1 or over, and this since 1.0b15.

MOVING FROM 1.0b12 THROUGH b15.2 to B16:  Existing users running these
versions MUST RUN THE UPGRADE PROCESS of the installer to move to 1.0b16.

MOVING FROM 1.0b11 TO b16: Users of 1.0b11 should use the 1.0b12.2
package, and upgrade process, prior to moving to 1.0b16, or go for a fresh
install of 1.0b16 if they are having problems with the b12.2 releases.


NETJUKE UPGRADE PROCEDURE:


1. RENAME YOUR CURRENT INSTALL TO netjuke-old. You will need to move
   the existing preference file and other variable content to the new
   release in the next steps.


2. Unpack the new version in a web accessible directory, in place of
   the previous copy (It is important that the new release matches the
   path that are in your current preference file moved below).


3. Copy or move your existing preference file to the new version
   of the application you just unpacked.


4. Move the content of your previous netjuke/var/ directory to the
   new release (music, symbolic links, data backups, images, etc).
   
   + Note: if you replace the files in var/html/* by the ones you
     had in the previous version, your netjuke might display a wrong
     version number at the top-right of the screen, but it still was
     upgraded successfully. These are optional & modifiable files
     that you might not want to overwrite if you customized them.
   
   + Note that 1.0b16 brings a new "jukebox" directory in netjuke/var/data.
     that needs to be writable by the web server, or everybody.


5. Make sure the following resources are writable by the web
   server user (eg: nobody, www, apache) or world writable
   in the NEW copy:

   + netjuke/etc/inc-prefs.php
   + netjuke/var/data (and everything within)
   
   + if you use symbolic links anywhere, make sure the targeted
     original targeted directory is readable, and that apache is
     setup to follow symbolic links (FollowSymLinks).


6. Go to http://.../netjuke/installer/installer.php and proceed with
   the UPGRADE PROCESS of the installer (license + docs + web form).


7. OPTIONAL: After trying to login to the new release to be safe, you
   can now delete your old copy (renamed as netjuke-old in step 1)


If you forget to backup you preference file, you will need to run the
installer to generate a new one. You will also need to manually drop
the database, or use the db-drop_*.sql scripts provided with the
netjuke-toolkit, as the installer will not overwrite them for security
purposes (avoids remote attacks on live copies).


Finally, do check out the updated docs to keep track of what's new
and what's coming soon.


Enjoy the new release! :o)
