Let the drop-down menu at the top of this page serve as your guide to jumping directly to the different parts of your website.  Here is a quick rundown of the tools for editing your main pages that are found in the menu to your left:

<UL>

<LI><B>Templates</B> controls the layout of your main pages.

<LI><B>Colors</B> controls the color of the text, background, and links of your main pages.

<LI><B>Body</B> controls the text, images, and headers that you insert into your main pages.

<LI><B>Internal Links</B> allows you to link to as many as 10 other pages within your website from your main pages.

<LI><B>Footer</B> controls the text, music, images that you place at the very bottom of your main pages. 

<LI><B>MetaTags</B> controls the information about a specific page that you submit to search engines.

<LI><B>Counter</B> controls the counter style and text that appears on your main pages.

<LI><B>Reset Counter</B> controls the number that appears on your counters.

<LI><B>View Page</B> allows you to view the progress of a page as you're working on it!  

</UL><P><B>Hint:</B> Preview allows you to see the changes you make to your site before you save them, and View Page allows you to see the changes only after you save them. 

<P><B>Hint:</B> If you do not see your changes taking effect, right-click and select Refresh, as you may be viewing an expired version.  If that does not work, you probably forgot to save your changes and may have to re-enter them.
