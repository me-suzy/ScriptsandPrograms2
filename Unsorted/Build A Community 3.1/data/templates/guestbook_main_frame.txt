This is where you can edit your guestbook page.  Let the drop-down menu at the top of this page serve as your guide to jumping directly to the different parts of your website.  Here is a quick rundown of the tools for editing your guestbook page that are found in the menu to your left:


<IMG SRC="PLUGIN:_BUTTONDIR/myguy/signature.gif" WIDTH=121 HEIGHT=128 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Let me be your guide">

<UL>

<LI><B>Colors</B> controls the color of the text, background, and links of your guestbook page.



<LI><B>Body</B> allows you to enter the main content of your guestbook page.



<LI><B>Internal Links</B> allows you to link to as many as 10 other pages within your website from your guestbook page.




<LI><B>Remove Entries</B> allows you to manually delete any unwanted guestbook entries. 




<LI><B>View Page</B> allows you to view the progress of your guestbook page as you're working on it!  </UL>

<P><B>Hint:</B> Preview allows you to see the changes you make to your site before you save them, and View Page allows you to see the changes only after you save them. 

<P><B>Hint:</B> If you do not see your changes taking effect, right-click and select Refresh, as you may be viewing an expired version.  If that does not work, you probably forgot to save your changes and may have to re-enter them.
