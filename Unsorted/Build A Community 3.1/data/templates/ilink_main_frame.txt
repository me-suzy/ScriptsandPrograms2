This is where you can edit your search engine page.  Here is a quick rundown of the tools for editing your search engine page that are found in the menu to your left:

<UL>

<LI><B>Colors</B> controls the color of the text, background, and links of your search engine page.

<LI><B>Body</B> allows you to enter the main content of your search engine page.


<LI><B>Internal Links</B> allows you to link to as many as 10 other pages within your website from your search engine page.

<LI><B>View Page</B> allows you to view the progress of your guestbook page as you're working on it!  

<LI><B>Edit Links</B> allows you to add and remove site links.

<LI><B>Edit Categories</B> allows you to add and remove site categories.



<P><B>Hint:</B> Preview allows you to see the changes you make to your site before you save them, and View Page allows you to see the changes only after you save them. 


<P><B>Hint:</B> If you do not see your changes taking effect, right-click and select Refresh, as you may be viewing an expired version.  If that does not work, you probably forgot to save your changes and may have to re-enter them.
