This is where you can edit the page that allows visitors to search the contents of your site.  Let the drop-down menu at the top of this page serve as your guide to jumping directly to the different parts of your website.  Here is a quick rundown of the tools for editing your site search page that are found in the menu to your left:

<IMG SRC="PLUGIN:_BUTTONDIR/myguy/search.gif" WIDTH=114 HEIGHT=128 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Let me be your guide">

<UL>

<LI><B>Colors</B> controls the color of the text, background, and links of your search page.

<LI><B>Body</B> allows you to enter the main content of your search page.

<LI><B>View Page</B> allows you to view the progress of your search page as you're working on it!  

</UL>



<P><B>Hint:</B> Preview allows you to see the changes you make to your site before you save them, and View Page allows you to see the changes only after you save them. 




<P><B>Hint:</B> If you do not see your changes taking effect, right-click and select Refresh, as you may be viewing an expired version.  If that does not work, you probably forgot to save your changes and may have to re-enter them.
