This is where you can edit your forum (bbs) page.  Let the drop-down menu at the top of this page serve as your guide to jumping directly to the different parts of your website.  Here is a quick rundown of the tools for editing your forum page that are found in the menu to your left:

<UL>

<LI><B>Colors</B> controls the color of the text, background, and links of your forum page.

<LI><B>Body</B> allows you to enter the main content of your forum page.

<LI><B>View Page</B> allows you to view the progress of your forum page as you're working on it!  

<LI><B>Remove by Thread</B> allows you to manually delete any unwanted threads from your forum. 

<LI><B>Remove by Post</B> allows you to manually delete any unwanted posts from your forum. 

<LI><B>Remove by Date</B> allows you to manually delete any items from a certain date. 

<LI><B>Remove by Author</B> allows you to manually delete the posts of certain people. 

</UL>



<P><B>Hint:</B> Preview allows you to see the changes you make to your site before you save them, and View Page allows you to see the changes only after you save them. 

<P><B>Hint:</B> If you do not see your changes taking effect, right-click and select Refresh, as you may be viewing an expired version.  If that does not work, you probably forgot to save your changes and may have to re-enter them.
