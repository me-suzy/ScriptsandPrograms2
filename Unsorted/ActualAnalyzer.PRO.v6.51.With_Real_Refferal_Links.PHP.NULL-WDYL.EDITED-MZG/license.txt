PARTY.

     6. General.
     Any  attempt  to sublicense, assign or transfer any of the rights, duties
or obligations hereunder is void.

     7. Technical Support.
     Once  you        have licensed the Software, technical support is available via
e-mail        and  help  boards.  Technical  support        may  be discontinued for older
versions  of  our  products  at any time. If you are using a version for which
support  has been discontinued, you will need to upgrade to a newer version in
order  to  receive further support.

     In  order to receive technical support, you must have an unedited copy of
the  Software  running        on your server. The only sections of code that you may
edit  are  those that are mentioned in the documentation for the Software. Any
other  editing        of the Softwar e will result in the loss of technical support.
We do not provide technical support for modified Software.

     For  technical support requests, please allow 12-18 hours for a response.
We  do        not  have  a 24-hour staff to handle the requests we get, so please be
patient  when  requesting assistance. We do not provide telephone tech support
at  this  time.  To  date, we  have been able to successfully resolve ALL tech
support  issues  through  e-mail and the help boards, so just because we don't
offer phone support doesn't mean we can't help. The tech support staff will be
able  to  assist  you  with  problems  you encounter with the  Software itself
(software  generated error messages). It is assumed that your server meets the
requirements of the software.

     The  tech        support  staff        will  be  able to assist you with problems you
encounter  with the Software itself (software generated error messages). It is
assumed  that  your  server  meets  the requirements of the software. The tech
support  staff can not offer server administration services to get your server
properly configured to run the software.

     If you alter or modify the Software which results in the Software ceasing
to  function  or  not to function properly, there will be an additional fee if
you require us to correct the error.

     8. Refund Policy.
     We do not refund any monies for return of the Licensed Product. ALL SALES
ARE  FINAL. The operating system and other requirements are clearly stated, so
make  sure  that  your system meets those requirements before you purchase the
Licensed  Product. Prior to your purchase you have the opportunity to view the
demo and ask us questions to make sure that the Software suits your needs - no
refunds  will  be  given  on the basis that the Licensed Product does not meet
your  requirements.  Any refunds or chargebacks  processed without the consent
of ActualScripts, Company will result in legal action against you for software
piracy. We take this issue very seriously, and have no tolerance for those who
pirate software products.

     9. Installation Policy.
     Installation  consists  of  us  asking you a series of questions, getting
your  server  login information, uploading all required files, setting all the
variables  according  to your answers, and making sure the script is operating
properly  within  your        server        capabilities. Once  that is completed, we will
contact you with the information you need to begin working with the Software.

     By  providing  your login information to us for installation services you
are  authorizing us to access your web site, make changes, create directories,
upload files and all other necessary actions to get the software installed and
operating  pursuant  to  our  standard        specifications.  Additionally, you are
permitting  us        to  retain the login information for future technical support,
should        it be needed and for removal of the Software in the event your license
is  terminated        pursuant  to  the terms hereof. You will indemnify and hold us
harmless  for  all damages that arise from our access to your site and hold us
harmless  for, and hereby expressly assume all risk for, any violation of your
agreement with your web site host or provider.

     We  do not offer installation services for beta versions of our software.
All  installations  are done with the latest stable release of the product you
purchase.

     10. Confidentiality.
     Your  personal  information  will        be  kept  confidential and will not be
disclosed to a third party unless we are presented with a court order ordering
us  to        do so. We reserve the right to use your web site URL as an example for
other  potential customers to  view. We reserve the right to link to your site
whenever you are using the Software.
