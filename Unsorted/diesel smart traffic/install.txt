More Details :

+ EDITING conf/sys.conf (the configuration file)

First you must set the access details for your MySQL database :
   $db_host = "localhost";
   $db_name = "mysqldatabasename";
   $db_login ="mysqluser";
   $db_pswd = "mysqlpassword";


Then the path to your website (with "/" in the end):
    $ROOT_HOST = "http://www.yourwebsite.com/";

The absolute path to lib/pear folder where the mass email libraries are stored:
    $pear_location="/home...lib/pear";
Run displaypath.php that will display the absolute path of displaypath.php script if you don't know where the files are stored.

The "from" email for sending messages and paid emails:
    $ADMIN_MAIL = "webmaster@your-website.com";
    $PAID_MAIL = "webmaster@your-website.com";

The payment details for predefined paypal and egold payment gateways (you can add payment modes in the admin): 
    $ADMIN_PAYPAL = "webmaster@your-website.com";
    $ADMIN_EGOLDN = "ntm3k";
    $ADMIN_EGOLD = "853366";
Set buy_paypal.php and buy_egold.php as payment links in packages to use these.
For links that start with http:\\ the script does not pass the package variables (in case you define the packages in 2checkout or other processor).

The details for accessing the admin area:
    $ADMIN_LOGIN = "admin";
    $ADMIN_PSWD = "admin";

Enable modules (1=enabled, 2=disabled) :
    $exchange["banner"]=1;
    $exchange["exit"]=1;
    $exchange["start"]=1;
    $exchange["popunder"]=1;
    $exchange["popup"]=1;
    $exchange["ppc"]=1;

+ Setting WRITE PERMISSIONS

The php scripts require write permissions for editing those files. Use CHMOD 777 to be sure it works.
It's only needed from editing templates and some settings from the admin area.


Enjoy, WDYL
