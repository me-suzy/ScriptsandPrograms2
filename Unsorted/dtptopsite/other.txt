Top 5 On the front page Add on.
_______________________________


This one is real simple, just upload the top5.cgi and chmod to 755
into the same directory as the topsites script.

Then put a SSI call where ever you want the TOP5 to appear.

E.g

<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/topsites/top5.cgi" -->

or

<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/topsites/top5.cgi" -->
