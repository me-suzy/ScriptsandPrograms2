                        Hotlink Protector!<br>
                        <br>
                        Follow these simple instructions to install the script, 
                        if you require assistance or need us to install for you, 
                        contact us at <a href="mailto:help@hotlinkprotector.com">help@hotlinkprotector.com</a></font><b><font face="arial" size="2"><br>

                        <font size="3" color="#0000FF">Customization</font> <br>
                        </font></b><font face="arial" size="2">First, open up 
                        the .htaccess file with notepad. You will notice lines 
                        like <br>
                        <b>RewriteRule ^(.*)\.jpg$ r.php?a=$1.jpg [L]<br>
                        </b>To protect a file type (that is not already included 
                        in the file), insert the line </font><b><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
                        RewriteRule ^(.*)\.XXX$ r.php?a=$1.XXX [L]<br>
                        </font></b><font face="arial" size="2">where XXX is the 
                        file type you would like to protect from hotlinking. To 
                        remove a filetype, simply delete the line containing the 
                        file type from the file.<br>
                        Upload the file to your server in the directory you would 
                        like to protect. To protect all directory trees, place 
                        the htaccess file in the root directory.<br>
                        <br>
                        Next, open up r.php in notepad. There are several variables 
                        that you may need to set. $domain contains &quot;safe&quot; 
                        domains - users downloading from these domains will be 
                        able to download their requested file. <b>Make sure your 
                        domain is added to the list.</b> To add a safe domain, 
                        use the syntax <b>$domain[X] = &quot;domain.com&quot;; 
                        </b>on each line. X refers to an integer. For example, 
                        to add a third domain to the list, use:<br>
                        $domain[0] = &quot;domain1.com&quot;;<br>
                        $domain[1] = &quot;domain2.com&quot;; </font><b><font face="arial" size="2"><a href="http://www.angelmovies.net/test.mpg"><br>
                        </a></font></b><font face="arial" size="2">$domain[2] 
                        = &quot;domain3.com&quot;; </font><b><font face="arial" size="2"><a href="http://www.angelmovies.net/test.mpg"><br>
                        <br>
                        </a></font></b><font face="arial" size="2">$logging is 
                        the option on whether to log statistics or not. Set this 
                        value to 1 to enable logging, 0 to disable it. <br>
                        $password is the password needed to view the statistics. 
                        Set this to whatever you like. MySQL is required for statistics. 
                        $mini_log saves the data to a text file. Generally, if 
                        you need to reduce server load turn this on - normally 
                        this should be off.<br>
                        <br>
                        $sessions is the option on whether to enable sessions 
                        or not. Sessions refers to the algorithm that makes sure 
                        that users must visit your site in order to download a 
                        file. This is used to allow people from downloading from 
                        download accellerators, media player, etc without allowing 
                        empty referrers to download your content. Once a user 
                        visits your page, they may download files off your server 
                        in any way they like for a timelimit set in $session_timeout. 
                        This feature requires MySQL.<br>
                        <br>
                        $visitonly refers to whether users can download files 
                        ONLY if they have visited your website. 1 to enable this, 
                        0 to disable it. We have coded it so you can specify which 
                        filetypes to incorporate $visitonly for. See below to 
                        $v documentation for help on how to work with this. MySQL 
                        and sessions are required for this to work.<br>
                        <br>
                        $redirect is the option on whether you would like to redirect 
                        users to another file if they are hotlinking. Set this 
                        to 1 to enable it, 0 to disable. Additional infomation 
                        on how to edit the files sent to hotlinkers is below.<br>
                        <br>
                        $send_headers is used if you want the user to be redirected 
                        to a similar filetype. It helps the browser determine 
                        what is being sent to them. If youre redirecting to a 
                        website or something, turn this off.<br>
                        <br>
                        $country_redirect allows you to redirect users from a 
                        specific country to another page. $redirect_url is the 
                        url to redirect them. When installing the script, the 
                        country table may take a while to be created, since it 
                        contains 15000+ records. Download the latest database 
                        from http://www.hotlinkprotector.com/ip-to-country.csv, 
                        and upload it to your webserver. To set the countries, 
                        edit the $cr variables. Youll need the exact country name. 
                        To get them, simply view the csv file with excel.<br>
                        <br>
                        $addiptosite automatically adds users ips to the database 
                        if they visit one of your webpages. Edit $pagetypes to 
                        set the extensions of your website. Be sure to edit your 
                        .htaccess file and add the filetypes to there so the script 
                        can catch requests to those filetypes.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="arial" size="2">Additional headers are not 
                        neccessary, but help a lot in helping the browser determine 
                        what type of file is being sent, as well as its filesize 
                        and type. They follow the syntax $m[<b>a</b>][<b>b</b>] 
                        where <b>a</b> is the group, and <b>b</b> is the data. 
                        When b is 0, it refers to the filetype for which the following 
                        headers are sent for. When b &gt; 0, the script will send 
                        the headers from 1 to infinity. Most common filetypes 
                        are already accounted for, and you will likely not have 
                        to edit this. $ma[x] are headers sent for ALL filetypes. 
                        Headers are very powerful. You can add cache information 
                        in headers or redirect to external servers.<br>
                        <br>
                        $r[<b>x</b>] refers to the files to send to users that 
                        hotlink files. <b>x</b> is the group number for the files. 
                        If you want to redirect users that hotlink a gif from 
                        you to another image, look up gif in the table of $m[<b>a</b>][0], 
                        and youll find it in the line $m[5][0] = &quot;gif&quot;;. 
                        Insert the line $r[5] = &quot;file.gif&quot;; to redirect 
                        hotlinkers that request *.gif to file.gif. <br>

                        <b>x</b> again is the group number of the files. If you 
                        want to enable make sure visitors can only download a 
                        file if they have visited your page, set $v[<b>x</b>] 
                        = &quot;1&quot;;. This is best used for large files, such 
                        as movies only. This will only work if a users IP has 
                        been added to the MySQL table. The IP is automatically 
                        added to legit users that download a filetype where $v[x] 
                        is not 1, such as an image on your website that you have 
                        not set the filetype to 1. <br>
