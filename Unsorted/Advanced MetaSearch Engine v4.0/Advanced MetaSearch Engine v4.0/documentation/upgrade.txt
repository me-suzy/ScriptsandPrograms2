Please read this carefully if you are upgrading from a previous version.
Although it will be a fresh, new installation; this document will help 
you make the conversion virtually without any service interruption.

   Advantage: You do NOT need to interrupt your current search engine.


Upgrade Notes:
-------------

1. Rename the main script file 'cgsearch.cgi' to 'cgsearch1.cgi'.


2. Make the installation as mentioned in the attached 'ReadMe.txt' file.
   (follow the 'Installation' instructions)
   All the other files and sub-directories in this Version 4.0 are 
   named differently. They will NOT overwrite any useful files on your 
   current installation. 
   Just remember, that your main script file is 'cgsearch1.cgi' 
   (not 'cgsearch.cgi as mentioned in the ReadMe file).
   

3. Once installation is complate, call the script from a browser using 
   the following URL:
	http://your-server.com/cgi-bin/cgsearch/cgsearch1.cgi
	
   If everything is OK, it should be working just fine. Now, continue 
   reading the 'Usage' and 'Customizations' sections for details on 
   customization and usage.


4. Once you have completed all the necessary customizations 
   (both Template/s and Search Configurations), some search to 
   make sure everything is working correctly.
   
   Now, rename your New 'cgsearch1.cgi' back to 'cgsearch.cgi'.
   
   From this moment your visitors will be using your new Version 4.0 
   Advanced MetaSearch Engine.


5. DONE !!!
   Now, you can safely delete the following items (from previous version) 
   safely:
   
   cg_html.pl   - file
  
   templates    - sub-directory and its contents 
                  NOTE: not the New sub-directory 'template'.
   
   logs         - sub-directory and its contents (if you have it)
   
   eng-web      - sub-directory and its contents (old engine-module sub-directory)
                  NOTE: not the New sub-directory 'engs-web'.
   
                  If you have any other Specialty-Search packages 
                  installed, delete all these old engine-module sub-directory)
   You do NOT need these above files, modules and sub-directories anymore.
