1. Customizing the Template
____________________________________________________________________________	


You can customize the layout of individual elements and design of 
your Advanced MetaSearch Template in every possible way. The overall 
design of the result pages is created using the Template (located in 
the 'template' subdirectory). You can set any HTML page with your own 
design and layout or simply modify the Template file that came with 
the package.
The Template can have any HTML elements (links, images, javascripts, 
banners etc.) plus Dynamic TAGs (##links##, ##linkbar## etc.) 
generated by the main script.

The example Template that came with this package includes working
example and how individual elements are shown using dynamic TAGs. You 
can open it with a Text Editor and have a look at the code for a clearer 
understanding.


(1.a) The MAP
-------------

When a search is made the main 'Advanced MetaSearch Engine' script 
processes the search request and stores ALL output details in a list 
of TAGs. You just add these TAGs on your Template where you want that 
element to show-up. 

Although all TAGs are dynamically generated, some TAGs are called 
'Global' TAGs and can be added anywhere on the Template BUT some 
TAGs MUST be placed with-in a Marked area. We will call this Marked area 
'MAP' (or Layout MAP). TAGs that MUST only be used with-in this MAP are 
called 'Dynamic' TAGs.

Tip:
MAP is the area Marked with-in a pre-selected pair of HTML comment mark: 

<!--CG_DATA_OUTPUT_MAP--> 

	
Example (Template HTML code):

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Search Results for: ##keywords## </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=FFFFFF  ...etc..   >

.
.
Your HTML goes here (Header, Links, Images, Banners etc.)
.
.

<!--CG_DATA_OUTPUT_MAP--> 


     THIS IS THE 'MAP' AREA between these 2 Comment Marks. 
     These 2 marks (above and below) MUST be present on your Template/s.
     All individual result elements 
     (result links, linkbar, toolbox etc. must be placed here.
     
     See the working example Template/s that came with your package.
     You can simply copy-and-paste them to your own Template.


<!--CG_DATA_OUTPUT_MAP-->

.
.
Your HTML goes here (Footers, Links, Images, Banners etc.)
.
.

</BODY>
</HTML>
		

(1.b) Showing Result Elements using 'Global' and 'Dynamic' TAGs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

'Global' TAGs are visible all over the Template and can be used ANYWHERE 
on the Template.

'Dynamic' TAGs are used to disply specific dynamically generated 
Result-Elements on the Template (on the result pages). All you need 
to do is add the necessary TAG where that specific element should 
appear.

IMPORTANT:
'Dynamic' TAGs MUST only be used with-in the MAP. (see the above 
1.a Section). 

FOR A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE TAGS ARE USED, PLEASE HAVE 
A LOOK AT THE CODE OF THE TEMPLATE/S PROVIDED (IN THE 'template' 
SUB-DIRECTORY).

TIP: 
use of TAGs allows you to show the same element on multiple places 
(on the Template) where they are allowed to be used. 


Global TAGs:
----------------

##scripturl##     - URL of your metasearch script. You can use it in 
                    the 'ACTION' of your Search Form (recommended).

##keywords##      - Input 'Keywords' in original form (plain text).

##enckeywords##   - Input 'Keywords' in encoded form (suitable for 
                    using in the url of a HTML link or creating dynamic 
                    linking.

##adkeywords##    - Input 'Keywords' Clean, filtered and encoded.
                    Suitable for passing to almost any Ad-Banner 
                    programs (where supported). It can also be used 
                    for dynamic linking.
                    
##randomnum1##   - Unique random number. Suitable for using any 
                    purpose where an unique number need to be added 
                    each time.


##randomnum2##   - Unique random number. Suitable for using any 
                    purpose where an unique number need to be added 
                    each time.
                    
                    NOTE: ##randomnum1## and ##randomnum2## will 
                    generate different numbers. If you are using 2 
                    banners (perhaps at the top and bottom) where 
                    you need to pass unique numbers use ##randomnum1## 
                    in one place and ##randomnum2## in other.


##ss##            - Passes current 'Family-Filter' setting between 
                    search calls (if used). Only effective if you have 
                    the 'Safe-Search' addon installed.
                    

The following Global TAGs are simply used to maintain state between 
Specialty-Search options (including 'Advanced Directory') where they 
are all working as an interrelated Complex Portal. You can have a look 
at the Template/s that came with the main package for details.
NOTE: UNLESS (OR UNTIL) YOU ARE USING OTHER SPECIALTY-SEARCH OPTIONS YOU 
WILL NOT SEE ANY EFFECT USE OF THEM.

##where##         - Search-Target (value of Form Input 'where').
##category##      - 'Advanced Directory' category information
##directoryurl##  - 'Advanced Directory' URL


Dynamic TAGs:
----------------

NOTE: these 'Dynamic' TAGs must ONLY be used with-in the MAP; i.e., 
in the area with-in the following HTML comments:

<!--CG_DATA_OUTPUT_MAP--> <!--start-->

	<!--  ALL 'Dynamic' TAGs must be used here 
	      as part of your HTML design             -->

<!--CG_DATA_OUTPUT_MAP--> <!--end-->



##links##           - Results (Links)

##start_linknum##   - Starting number of links shown on 
                      this result page.

##end_linknum##     - Ending number of links shown on
                      this result page.

##linkbar##         - Displays the Link-Bar 
                      (link to other result pages).

##link_pagenum##    - current Result page number.

##link_total##      - Total number of links. 
                      (after Sorting/Duplicate-Removal if such setting 
                      are On. May be less than ##rawtotal##, see below)

##rawtotal##        - Total number of results fetched.

##toolbox##         - Shows the Tool-Box.
                      (Show/Hide Description/Source etc.)

##link_perpage##    - How many results are being shown Per_page.

##total_pages##     - Total number of result-pages.

##kw_match##        - If the Keyword Matching Search option is on 
                      this will display Keyword Matchings (search-ready 
                      URLs) in a HTML table format. 
                      See the '$kwmatch_searching' parameter in the 
                      Search Configuration file (in the sub-directory 
                      'conf', Section F).
                      NOTE: even if set Keyword matching Search to 'off' 
                      you should still keep this ##kw_match## TAG on your 
                      Template. This will save time (you won't have to 
                      modify your Template/s again) in case you want to 
                      set Keyword Matching Search to 'on' in future.


##error_msg##       - If a search fails due to 'Bad/Poor Keyword' input OR 
                      'No Keywords' OR 'No results Found' this TAG will show 
                      appropriate Error Message.
                      (See 'Section G' in your Search Configuration file)


NOTE:
It is always recommended, that you have a good look at the HTML codes of 
the example Template provided with the package. This will help understand 
the TAGs and their usage quickly and easily.



(1.c) Using containers for better control on 'Dynamic' TAGs 
------------------------------------------------------------

This feature applies to 'Dynamic' TAGs ONLY. Although it is 
optional to most of the 'Dynamic' TAGs; if used correctly they 
will enable you to use the 'Dynamic' TAGs more efficiently.

Advanced MetaSearch containers are like usual HTML containers 
with the exception that they start with the string 'show_' 
followed by the actual TAG name (without the '##' string). These 
containers must also be closed with same container name BUT with 
a '/' at the beginning of the container name.


EXAMPLE: 
for the TAG ##linkbar## the container should be like:

<show_linkbar>    <!-- container for ##linkbar## starts -->

##linkbar##       <!-- Actual TAG must be inside -->

</show_linkbar>   <!-- container for ##linkbar## closes/ends -->



Tip: 
	This is exactly similar to usual HTML containers. Like
	a <table> container must be closed with </table>, 
	OR a <FORM ...> container must also be closed with 
	a </FORM> container
	OR a <font ...> container must also have a closing container 
	</font>

IMPORTANT !!!
	For simplicity of usage, nested containers (one container 
	with-in another) is NOT ALLOWED. In fact there is probably 
	NO NEED for this.

	Do NOT put spaces in the containers. Container <show_linkbar> 
	must not be written as < show_linkbar> or <show_linkbar > 
	or < show_linkbar >.
	Same way, closing containers must also be WITHOUT any 
	spaces.
	
	The actual TAG should be present with-in the container.
	Example: the container for ##linkbar## should contain 
	the TAG ##linkbar## with-in it. Other wise the value 
	of ##linkbar## will not appear in the final output.
	See the above Example.


Advantages of using containers:
------------------------------

Lets say you are giving the visitors the option to choose how many 
results should be shown per-page and the option to show ALL results 
are included in the option-field 'pp' (this Form Input controls how 
many results should be shown per-page)

At the same time, you are showing the Link-Bar with some text labels 
like:

More Results: ##linkbar##

Now, if all results can be shown on the first result-page; the script 
will NOT create the Link-Bar (because there is NO more result pages to 
link to)

If this happens, the visitor will still see the text label: 

More Results: 
(the ##linkbar## TAG contains no value)

This might look odd on a professional search engine; where you are 
declaring the availability of some more results (result-pages); where 
they are not present.

Use of containers stops such things from happening. Now, if you would 
put the ##linkbar## as shown below:

<show_linkbar>
More Results: ##linkbar##
</show_linkbar>

then the contents with-in the above container will only be shown if 
ONLY if the TAG ##linkbar## has some real value to output. Now, your 
visitors will no longer see the bare 'More Results: ' text when in fact 
there is no more result pages.

Tip:
It is probably recommendable that you put the following 'Dynamic' TAGs 
with-in containers if you are showing them with some additional text 
label:

##linkbar##
##error_msg##

NOTE: use if containers is optional. You do NOT have to use them. They 
simply help you maintain a more professional way of showing the search 
results.

The example Template includes some HTML comments for explanation purposes. 
You can safely remove the unnecessay comments as required.


(1.d) Showing Search Fail Messages
-----------------------------------

If a search fails due to any of the following reasons, you can 
show appropriate messages using the 'Dynamic' TAG ##error_msg##

This ##error_msg## TAG must be placed with-in the MAP.

Example:

##error_msg##

or, with-in a container

<show_error_msg>
##error_msg##
</show_error_msg>

or, with-in a container with some additional text:

<show_error_msg>

<p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="3">Search Fail Report:</font>

##error_msg##

</show_error_msg>


NOTE: You can customize the default Error messages by modifying them 
in the Search Configuration file (in the sub-directory 'conf'). See 
the 'Section G'.


____________________________________________________________________________	

2. Customizing Dynamic Output (Internal Customizations)
____________________________________________________________________________	


You can further customize the dynamically generated result elements by 
modifying the Search Configuration file/s located in the 'conf' sub-directory.

These Internal Customizations will change the output data passed on to the 
the TAGs that you use on the Template.

To do so, open the Search Configuration file (web.pl etc.) with a Plain Text 
Editor and make the necessary modifications. ALL the items are thoroughly 
commented and explained in detail.
