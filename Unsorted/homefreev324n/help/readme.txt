Introduction:

This is my hacked version of HomeFree v3.24, which is
essentially the exact same version as what was recently
released as HomeFree v3.25 (the newer version was changed
to update links to their new website).

OK, here's the 'Nullified' version 3.24n deal:

1. The check reg key function has been located and disabled
   within these v3.24n scripts.

2. When you install this script package, just ignore the reg
   key field and you will never see it again!

3. Full installation instructions can be found in the
   install.html file located in the Help folder.

4. This package is supplemented with help files saved from the
   on-line Manual at the 'home' website. These help files are 
   linked from within the v3.24n scripts... to whatever path
   you specify during setup. Meaning that in addition to the 
   installation instructions listed in install.html, you have
   the option of linking the help files either from your server,
   or on your hard drive.

   Note: While the easiest way is to place these help files on
   your server, it is possible to call them from your hard
   drive by placing your local drive/path

      (ie. file:///C|/scripts/homefree/help or whatever?)

   in the setup Help url variable... pick what's best for you.

5. I've added an environment variables script to the online setup
   and paths configuration script to help your setup, if needed.   

6. Every attempt has been made to thoroughly sanitize this
   package in addition to hacking the reg check... just be AWARE
   of any links you follow from ANY commercial scripts!  If you decide
   to follow links to .shtml pages back at the 'home' website (or
   links that end with / where there is likely to be an index.shtml),
   just realize you may in fact be tripping SSI flags and may have 
   your IP crawled by robots or spiders from 'home'... so, best to
   stay away from author's 'home' sites unless using a proxy, and try
   to stick to the help links I've supplemented this package with!
  
If you are totally in the dark... see /help/install.html and you will
have access to the full online manual via local files and links :-)!

This package has been somewhat rushed due to it's heavy demand, but it
is definitely nullified and needs no reg info... does not call 'home', 
has no user reg/licensee info, and as far as I've seen has no links 
back 'home'... It should be totally SAFE, but learn to heed my advice
with ANY scripts you use, about following ANY links that go 'home'...

PS: The help files are all relatively linked, so they are interactive
    whether stored on your server - or on your hard drive.
