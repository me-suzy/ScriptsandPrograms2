README.txt
==========

Copy the Phoundry Editor distribution directory to somewhere
in your Document Root.
Now point Internet Explorer to 'test.php' in this directory.
(Through a server, not by using File->Open!).
If the installation went okay, you should see the Phoundry
Editor in a basic FORM. (The image browser won't work!)
Make sure the 'test.php' page works. If it does, you can
start embedding it in your own FORM's.

Full and up-to-date documentation is available at 
http://editor.phoundry.com/docs/
You'll find installation instructions, requirements, examples, FAQs 
and much more there.
There's also an automated configuration-script at this site:
