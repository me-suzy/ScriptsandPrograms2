1) Open the script filecheck.cig and filechekcadmin.cgi. On the first line, make sure that the path to Perl is correct. If not, modify it. If not sure, check with your ISP.

2) Create this folder, upload the files and chmod accordingly. All files must be uploaded in ASCII mode.

http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/filecheck (777)
- filecheck.cgi (755)
- filecheckadmin.cgi (755)
- filecheck.dat (666 or 777 - preferably 666 for higher security)
- filecheck.config (666 or 777 - preferably 666 for higher security)

4) Configure the settings by calling up the script filecheckadmin.cgi from your browser. The defautl password is "upoint". You may change it.

5) Place this tag into your existing web page (remember to rename it to shtml extension) where you want the age indicator to appear:

<!--#include virtual="cgi-bin/filecheck/filecheck.cgi?X" -->
where X is a reference number. Please note that X must be set as a 5-digit number ONLY in the admin interface (such as 00001 or 00014). But in the SSI tags, the leading zeros can be omitted.

Example:
<!--#include virtual="cgi-bin/filecheck/filecheck.cgi?1" -->
<!--#include virtual="cgi-bin/filecheck/filecheck.cgi?14" -->

6) For more instruction, please execute the script filechekcadmin.cgi.
