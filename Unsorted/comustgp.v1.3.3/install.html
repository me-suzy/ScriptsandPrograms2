    from a web interface.</li>
  <li>Preferred submitters get a password. This helps fake submissions

    404 errors, your recip link, banned words and pop-ups.</li>
  <li>Added check for pop-up windows during gallery submission.</li>
  <li>Limit number of days galleries stay on main page</li>

    server is the &quot;includes&quot; folder.</li>

  <li>Set up all your category names</li>
  <li>You should be all set to go now. Just build your site and
    include the tgpinc.php and archiveinc.php within them.</li>
</ol>
<p>That about it for initial setup.</p>
<p>The heart of the site is the &quot;tgpinc.php&quot; and &quot;archiveinc.php&quot;
  files. These are meant to be includes within your main TGP and
  Archive pages. To do this, just make your site design and include
  these files with the code &quot;&lt;?php include ($DOCUMENT_ROOT
  . &quot;/includes/tgpinc.php&quot;) ?&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;?php
  include ($DOCUMENT_ROOT . &quot;/includes/archiveinc.php&quot;)
  ?&gt;&quot;. Be sure to save these new pages as &quot;tgp.php&quot;
  and &quot;archive.php&quot; respectively (I included samples
  you can build on).</p>

<p><b>A quick word on security</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Many people have asked me about securing their admin and
    includes directories. The way I do it, and I suggest you do
    to, is use .htaccess and .htpasswd files. For more info on
    how to do this, just search the web for .htaccess and you
    will find more than enough information.</p>

<p>If you have any questions.... just email me and ask.</p>
