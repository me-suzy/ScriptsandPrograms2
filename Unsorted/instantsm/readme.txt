Extract all the files to a folder of your choice (.i.e. site). The zip contains Instant site maker and all the images you need to create your sales web page. REMEMBER to change the ClickBank order link in the HTML file to your own nickname.

Creating your first page.

Two sample word documents are included to show how a typical sales page and thank you page are created from an MS Word document. These can be pasted directly into the sales text box in the software utility. The software requires Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 or higher to be installed on your PC.
