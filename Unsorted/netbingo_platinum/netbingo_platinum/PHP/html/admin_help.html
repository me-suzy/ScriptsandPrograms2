  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">This 
    page controls the contents of two files, config.inc in your PHP directory 
    and multiconfig.pl in your cgi-bin/multiplay directory.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">You 
    should not attempt to change these files directly for two reasons: you may 
    lose compatibility between the two and your admin configuration page may stop 
    working.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Hopefully, 
    the meaning of the parameters here is adequately documented in the page. Some 
    things to watch out for are:</font></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">trailing 
      slashes on directory names - some need them some don't - follow the instructions 
      on each carefully</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">retention 
      of game files - You need to keep the game files for at least as long as 
      a game can last. This is the total of<br>
      - maximum time for the game to start (game frequency)<br>
      - delay between balls * 75</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">session 
      expiry - This is how we measure how many users are logged into the site. 
      The user's session keeps getting refreshed as long as they are waiting for 
      a game or playing a game. You can set this to be quite short so the number 
      of users logged on the bottom of the frame is fairly accurate.</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">game 
      frequency - this is how frequently a game can start. It's possible to have 
      several games going simulteneously. For example, if the game frequency is 
      600 (5 minutes) and the ball delay is 10, then there can be two games going 
      simulteneously.</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">computer 
      can draw bingo - This is actually a bit of smoke and mirrors. After this 
      number of balls the computer draws a random number in the range 1 - 75 on 
      each ball drawing. If the random number is less than the current ball sequence 
      number, then the computer is deemed to have won. In other words, the longer 
      the game goes on, the more likely it is that the computer will win.</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">show 
      winners for current week - if &quot;no&quot;, then the top x winners for 
      all time are displayed. If &quot;yes&quot; then the top winners for the 
      current week (starts on Sunday) are displayed.</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">total 
      number of cards to display - 5 fits nicely into 640 x 480 display on one 
      line (using default graphics). You may need to change this if you change 
      the cell dimensions.</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">number 
      of cards on one line - number of cards horizontally across the screen.</font></div>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Use 
  this page to modify, add or delete awards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">When 
  a player wins or when they log in, the awards table is referenced to see if 
  they qualify for an award based on the number of wins accumulated. If so a table 
  is displayed showing all the awards and the levels at which they qualify. For 
  example if you have 4 levels for 25,50 75 100 wins and they have accumulated 
  55 wins, then they can claim an award at the 25 and 50 level, or &quot;let it 
  ride&quot; to go on for 75 or 100.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">If 
  they claim an award, then the number of wins is decremented by the amount of 
  the claim and they are taken to a claim page (claim_page.html) in the game docs 
  directory. You must customize this page yourself according to your own claim 
  processing requirements. Follow the instructions in claim_page.html.</font></p>
