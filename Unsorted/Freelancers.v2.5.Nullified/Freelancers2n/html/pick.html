If you are ready to select a freelancer for your project, follow the instructions below. 
Once you press the button the freelancer will be notified of your choice, 
and this project will be "frozen" so no other bids can be placed on it. 
They will FIRST have to accept the offer before anything is finalized.
If the freelancer does accept, you will both be put in contact to begin your project. 
The project will then be closed and archived. If the freelancer does not respond to your offer, you can choose a new one.
