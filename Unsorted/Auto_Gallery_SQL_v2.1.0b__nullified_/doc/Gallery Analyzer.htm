      face=Arial size=2><BR>The gallery analyzer was added in the 2.1.0 release 
      of AutoGallery SQL. It features support for counting the number of 
      thumbnails and other links on a gallery, taking a sample of the gallery 
      content to determine it's byte size and download speed, and a page ID 
      generator to uniquely identify gallery pages. The analyzer is used when 
      galleries are submitted and by the linkcheck utility. This document will 
      give an overview of the analyzer, and let you know how the setup.cgi 
      settings affect what it does. <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> Do not confuse this 
      with the linkcheck utility. The gallery analyzer is a built in feature of 
      the software that allows it to retrieve galleries and examine them. This 
      software feature is used by the linkcheck utility, but is also used by the 
      submission script so that galleries can be examined when they are 
      submitted. For information on using the linkcheck utility, see the 
      utilities.html documentation file. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      Counter</B> <BR><BR>This function of the gallery analyzer will look at the 
      HTML of the gallery page to determine how many thumbnails are on the page. 
      The analyzer requires that all thumbnails be linked directly to the larger 
      image or movie file. Any thumbnails not linked directly to the content 
      will be counted as regular links instead of thumbnails. <BR><BR><B>Link 
      Counter</B> <BR><BR>The gallery anzlyzer can count the number of links it 
      finds on the gallery page. This count does not include the thumbnail links 
      to the gallery content, it only counts the other links on the page. Every 
      &lt;a href&gt; tag is counted as one link. Even if there are multiple 
      links pointing to the same URL, each one is counted separately. 
      <BR><BR><B>Content Sampling</B> <BR><BR>The content sampler will check at 
      most 5 of the images or movies that the gallery links to. A random 
      selection of the gallery content is taken to create this sample. Each of 
      the 5 items will be downloaded from the gallery. Once downloaded, the 
      total byte size of the content is calculated and the download speed from 
      the gallery is recorded. <BR><BR><B>Page IDs</B> <BR><BR>Page IDs are 
      generated for every gallery in your database. The software uses the HTML 
      on the gallery to generate an ID value to identify it. It can then use 
      that ID to determine if there is another gallery in the database that has 
      the same HTML, and also to check if the page has changed since it was 
      submitted. To see if a page has changed, you can click on the Verify URL 
      link when displaying your posts through the administrative interface. 
      <BR><BR><B>Banned HTML</B> <BR><BR>The software allows you to setup HTML 
      that you do not want to appear on the gallery pages. This is useful to 
      block galleries that have pop-up consoles or certain text that you don't 
      want. The software will check the gallery page for each of the Banned HTML 
      items you have setup through the administrative interface. 
      <BR><BR><B>Reciprocal Link</B> <BR><BR>Getting galleries to link back to 
      you is an important part of running a TGP. The software allows you to 
      setup any number of valid reciprocal links that your submitters can use. 
      It can then check the gallery page to see if any one of those reciprocal 
      links appear. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      the software determine the number of pics on the gallery?</B> <BR><BR>With 
      this option enabled, the software will override whatever value the 
      submitter provides for the number of images on their gallery. The software 
      will automatically determine how many there are, and fill in the number of 
      images with that value. <BR><BR><B>Reject gallery URLs that forward (30x 
      status codes)?</B> <BR><BR>With this option enabled, the software will 
      reject any gallery URLs that produce a 300 level HTTP response code. 300 
      level response codes indicate that the page has moved to a new location, 
      and can potentially indicate that the submitter is trying to forward 
      traffic to some other page on their site. <BR><BR><B>Take sample of 
      gallery content to check speed and size?</B> <BR><BR>With this option 
      enabled, the software will take a sample of the gallery content. The 
      gallery will be rejected if any of the following hold true: <BR><BR>1. The 
      content that is sampled does not meet the minimum byte size 
      requirement.<BR>2. The download speed from the server does not meet the 
      minimum requirement.<BR>3. The URLs pointing to the content generate a 
      HTTP status code of 300+ <BR><BR><B>Check the number of links on the 
      gallery page?</B> <BR><BR>With this option enabled, the software will 
      reject a gallery if it has more than the allowed number of links, as 
      defined by the Maximum Links setup.cgi field. The software will always 
      count the number of links, but it will only reject galleries with 
      excessive links if this option is enabled. <BR><BR><B>Check for duplicate 
      gallery content?</B> <BR><BR>This option will check the database for a 
      duplicate page ID. If a page ID is duplicated, it will almost always mean 
      that a gallery with the same content is already in the database. 
      <BR><BR><B>Check for banned HTML on the gallery?</B> <BR><BR>This is 
      fairly self-explanatory. The software will check the gallery HTML to see 
      if any of it matches the HTML that you have banned. Galleries with banned 
      HTML will be rejected. <BR><BR><B>Check for a reciprocal link to your 
      site?</B> <BR><BR>This is fairly self-explanatory. The software will check 
      the gallery HTML to see if any of your defined reciprocal links can be 
      found. The results of the check will be entered in the database. 
      <BR><BR><B>Reciprocal link must be located on their gallery page?</B> 
      <BR><BR>This is basically a legacy function which most TGP administrators 
      have enabled. If it is not enabled, the reciprocal link can be on any 
      page. If it is enabled, the gallery URL is automatically filled in as the 
      reciprocal link URL by the software, and that is where it will look for 
      the reciprocal link. <BR><BR><B>Reject submissions that do not have a 
      reciprocal link?</B> <BR><BR>This is fairly self-explanatory. The software 
      will automatically reject any galleries which do not have one of your 
      defined reciprocal links on their page. <BR><BR><B>Give a +1 rating boost 
      to galleries that have a reciprocal link?</B> <BR><BR>This is fairly 
      self-explanatory. Standard submissions are given a rating of 1. With this 
      option enabled, galleries that have one of your defined reciprocal links 
      on their page will be given a rating of 2. <BR><BR><B>Valid Image/Movie 
      File Extensions</B> <BR><BR>When the gallery analyzer is looking for 
      thumbnails, it will use these file extensions to determine what type of 
      content the thumbnail should be linked to. Take the following example: 
      <BR><BR>&lt;a href="/images/fullsize.jpg"&gt;&lt;img 
      src="/images/thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <BR><BR>In this case the 
      software will examine the /images/fullsize.jpg link to make sure that jpg 
      is one of the allowed file extensions. Note that this does not affect the 
      thumbnail itself, only the content that the thumbnail is linked to.
