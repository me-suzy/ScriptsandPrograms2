      face=Arial size=2>Before you begin, make sure your brain is in HTML mode. 
      From here out, it is assumed that you understand HTML at the source level. 
      If you don't know HTML very well but want a very custom look to your site, 
      we recommend locating a professional HTML developer to assist you. HTML 
      coding is not a service we provide, and the tech support staff can only 
      provide limited assistance in getting your HTML to look how you want it - 
      this is why HTML knowledge is listed as a requirement when you purchase 
      the software. <BR><BR>Editing the HTML for your TGP Pages is done through 
      the administrative script. As you can see from the screenshot below, just 
      select the "Edit HTML For" function, then the page you want to edit.

      you even begin working on your HTML in the administrative interface, we 
      highly recommend that you layout how you want your TGP Page to look. This 
      can be done with your normal method for creating HTML pages. Once you have 
      a look that you are satisfied with, save the HTML so you can work with it 
      later in the adminisrative interface. <BR><BR>Take a moment now to look 
      over your HTML so you are sure you know how it works. The better you 
      understand your HTML now, the easier it will be for you to set it up in 
      the administrative script later. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      you get to the HTML editing interface you will be presented with one large 
      text box at the top and two smaller boxs at the bottom. They will be 
      labeled Main HTML, Template HTML, and Date Change HTML. This is where you 
      will place all of your HTML for the page you are working on. The first 
      time you view this page, the default HTML that is included with the 
      software will be displayed. You should look this over to get a general 
      idea of how things work. Add a few test submissions to your TGP, then 
      rebuild the pages so you can see how the HTML is written to the page. From 
      there, you can begin making changes to give the TGP pages your own look. 
      <BR><BR><B>Main HTML</B> <BR><BR>This box will contain 95% of the HTML you 
      want to use for the page you are working on, and controls the basic layout 
      of the page. In the places where you want a gallery to appear, you will 
      use special template code to indicate that. When the software builds your 
      page, it will then replace that special code with the code that you enter 
      in the Template HTML box. <BR><BR><B>Template HTML</B> <BR><BR>In this box 
      you will enter the HTML for a <I>single</I> gallery link. This HTML will 
      then be used for each of the galleries displayed on the selected page. 
      This HTML will generally include the gallery URL, description, number of 
      pics, and category. <BR><BR><B>Date Change HTML</B> <BR><BR>This HTML is 
      optional, but can be used to insert a specified piece of HTML each time 
      the date changes. This can be useful if you want to display a date and 
      then a section of galleries for that date. The only valid template value 
      that you can use in this field is #%DATE%#, which will display the date of 
      the galleries to follow. Each time the software detects a change in the 
      date from the previous gallery it will insert the HTML you enter in this 
      box. <BR><BR>Note that the date change HTML should only be used if you are 
      displaying your galleries sorted by approval date - it will not work if 
      they are sorted differently. This is the default method the software uses, 
      but if you have entered a custom sorting string in setup.cgi you need to 
      be aware of this. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      Main HTML box will contain 95% of the HTML for your TGP pages, and 
      controls the basic layout of your page. This portion will also tell the 
      software where you want your gallery links inserted, but not how you want 
      them to look. The template HTML tells the software how you want each 
      gallery link to appear, and that is covered in the next section. 
      <BR><BR>We are going to give a very simple example to work with in this 
      section. Below is a complete HTML page, and this is an example of the HTML 
      you can use in the Main HTML box. </FONT><XMP><html>
<head>
<title>TGP</title>
</head>
<body>

#%GALLERY_1%#
#%GALLERY_2%#
#%GALLERY_3%#
#%GALLERY_4%#
#%GALLERY_5%#

</body>
</html>
</XMP><FONT face=Arial size=2>As you can see, this block of code contains 
      the necessary elements to create a very basic HTML page. The part that 
      should not look familiar to you are the #%GALLERY_1%# through 
      #%GALLERY_5%# portions of text. These are the special codes you need to 
      use to tell the software where you want each of the gallery links placed. 
      On this sample page, there will be 5 gallery links displayed. 
      <BR><BR><B>The #%GALLERY_x%# Values</B> <BR><BR>In all of the following 
      text x represents a number between 1 and the total number of galleries you 
      have choosen to display per page on your TGP. It is important to note that 
      the x value does NOT correspond with the post IDs that are assigned to 
      submissions. <BR><BR>These values tell the software where to insert your 
      gallery links. Every time the software encounters one of these values, it 
      will examine it to determine which gallery to place in that spot. The 
      software will then take the Template HTML, fill in all of the values 
      contained in it, and put the resulting code in the location where the 
      #%GALLERY_x%# value was. <BR><BR><B>Categorizing</B> <BR><BR>The software 
      allows you to categorize your main TGP pages. In order to do this, you 
      have to use special versions of the<BR>#%GALLERY_x%# values. For every 
      category you have, there will be a corresponding #%GALLERY_x%# value for 
      you to use. Several examples are listed below. </FONT><PRE>      CATEGORY                 #%GALLERY_x%# Value
      --------                 -------------------
      Hardcore                 #%Hardcore_x%#

      FuNkY CaTEgoRy           #%FuNkY CaTEgoRy_x%#
      </PRE><FONT face=Arial size=2>The category name you enter in the 
      #%GALLERY_x%# value must match exactly with the category name you entered 
      in setup.cgi. An example of producing categorized output is listed below. 
      </FONT><XMP><html>

#%FuNkY CaTEgoRy_1%#
#%FuNkY CaTEgoRy_2%#
#%FuNkY CaTEgoRy_3%#
</body>
</html>
</XMP><FONT face=Arial size=2>When the software comes across the 
      #%Hardcore_1%# value, it will look up the first Hardcore gallery in your 
      database. The software will then take the Template HTML, fill in all of 
      the values contained in it, and put the resulting code in the location 
      where the #%Hardcore_1%# value was. <BR><BR><B>Displaying by Date</B> 
      <BR><BR>With AutoGallery SQL you have the option of displaying the most 
      recent days worth of posts. For this, you will use the following template 
      values. Note that these template values will only work if you have 
      selected the most recent days worth of posts display option in setup.cgi. 
      <BR><BR>#%DAY_1_1%#<BR>#%DAY_1_2%#<BR>#%DAY_1_3%#<BR>#%DAY_1_4%#<BR>#%DAY_1_5%# 
      <BR><BR>#%DAY_2_1%#<BR>#%DAY_2_2%#<BR>#%DAY_2_3%#<BR>#%DAY_2_4%#<BR>#%DAY_2_5%# 
      <BR><BR>DAY_1 is the most recent day, DAY_2 will be the day before, and so 
      on. <BR><BR><B>Inserting The Date of the Previous Gallery</B> <BR><BR>In 
      building your TGP page it is often useful to have access to the date of 
      the gallery preceeding some HTML you want to insert. For example, if you 
      want to insert a blind link in your list of galleries so that it blends 
      in, you can use this feature. To do this all you need to do is use a 
      #%DATEOF_GALLERY_x%# template value. Below is an example. 
      <BR><BR>#%GALLERY_1%#<BR>#%GALLERY_2%#<BR>#%GALLERY_3%#<BR>#%GALLERY_4%#<BR>#%GALLERY_5%#<BR>#%DATEOF_GALLERY_5%# 
      - &lt;a href="http://www.blindlink.com"&gt;15 Hardcore 
      Thumbs&lt;/a&gt;<BR>#%GALLERY_6%#<BR>#%GALLERY_7%#<BR><BR>For this example 
      #%DATEOF_GALLERY_5%# will be replaced with the approval date of the 
      gallery that is in the #%GALLERY_5%# position. This can be done for any 
      gallery, and also works if you are using the category template values by 
      using<BR>#%DATEOF_Category Name_x%# <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      surrounded by #%%# characters. For example, using #%CATEGORY%# in the

      category for the gallery it is currently printing to the HTML file.

      each of the template values has been explained, we will give a simple 
      example of how you can take your HTML and insert the template values in 
      the correct locations. Say that you want your list of gallery links to 
      look like the following: <BR><BR>12-20-2001 - <A class=orange 
      href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/owners/ags/bdocs/">18 Hardcore 
      Pics</A><BR>12-20-2001 - <A class=orange 
      href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/owners/ags/bdocs/">12 Softcore 
      Pics</A><BR>12-20-2001 - <A class=orange 
      href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/owners/ags/bdocs/">14 Teen 
      Pics</A><BR><BR>What you need to do is look at your HTML and detemine what 
      tags will generate <I>one</I> of those gallery links. In our case, the 
      HTML we have pulled out is: </FONT><BR><XMP>
12-20-2001 - <a href="" class="orange">18 Hardcore Pics</a><br>

</XMP><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now we can take this HTML and start plugging 
      in the template values at the correct locations. The first thing we will 
      do is replace the category with the #%CATEGORY%# template value: 
      </FONT><BR><XMP>
12-20-2001 - <a href="" class="orange">18 #%CATEGORY%# Pics</a><br>

</XMP><FONT face=Arial size=2>Next, lets put in the number of pics on the 
      gallery, #%NUM_PICS%# </FONT><BR><XMP>
12-20-2001 - <a href="" class="orange">#%NUM_PICS%# #%CATEGORY%# Pics</a><br>

</XMP><FONT face=Arial size=2>Finally, we'll add the #%APPROVE_DATE%# 
      template value to insert the date and the #%GALLERY_URL%# value for the 
      URL to the gallery </FONT><BR><XMP>
#%APPROVE_DATE%# - <a href="#%GALLERY_URL%#" class="orange">#%NUM_PICS%# #%CATEGORY%# Pics</a><br>

</XMP><FONT face=Arial size=2>That's all there is to it, you've just 
      created your first template. All of the HTML you need to use is listed on 
      the line directly above. It is important to note that you will only enter 
      the HTML for a <I>single</I> gallery link in the template field. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->
