      face=Arial size=2>As you may know, finding a great host for your website 
      can be very difficult. Because of this, it is sometimes required that you 
      move to a new server at a new hosting company. This document will give you 
      an overview of what needs to be done in order to transfer AutoGallery SQL 
      and your data to a new server. 
      <OL>
        <LI>The first thing you will want to do is backup your databases from 
        the old server. This is easily done through the administrative interface 
        using the database backup feature. Once you have generated your backup 
        files, download them to your local computer in ASCII mode. The backup 
        feature will backup most things for you, however if you have edited any 
        of the .htmlt or .etmpl files you will need to transfer those to your 
        new server seperately. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Next, you will need to install AutoGallery SQL on your new server. 
        It is very important that you do not copy any files over from your old 
        server. You should proceed with the installation as if it is the first 
        time it is being installed. Follow the instructions in <A 
        href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/owners/ags/bdocs/install.html">install.html</A> 
        to complete the installation. Once you have done that, you can upload 
        any customized .htmlt or .etmpl files to your templates directory, if 
        you haven't already. <BR><BR>
        <LI>After you have the new and clean installation done on your new 
        server, upload the database backup files to your data directory in ASCII 
        mode. Set the permissions on the database backup files to 666. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Now you can enter the administrative script on your new server, and 
        use the database restore function. Type in the filename of the backup 
        files, and use the restore function. All of your data will be recovered 
        in this process. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Once you have restored your data, you will want to run the rebuild 
        function to create all of your pages. <BR><BR>
        <LI>That's all there is to it. You are now ready to continue normal 
        operations. </LI></OL>Please note that this is the only method for 
      switching servers that is supported by JMB Software. If you do it any 
      other way we will not be able to provide technical assistance for errors 
      you encounter. </FONT></TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
