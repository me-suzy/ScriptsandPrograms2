      face=Arial size=2>For a webmaster to submit a gallery, you need to direct 
      them to the post.cgi script. Any old link to that script will do. Once 
      they get there, they will fill out a form with all the information that is 
      needed to make a submission. When they press the submit button, their URLs 
      are verified (optional), reciprocal links are checked (optional), and 
      their submission is then added to the appropriate database. 
      <BR><BR><B>E-mail Confirmation</B> <BR><BR>If you have the e-mail 
      confirmation option enabled, the webmaster's submission will be stored in 
      a temporary database. An e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address they 
      used with their submission. They will need to receive this e-mail and 
      visit the link that it contains. By visiting this link, it will verify 
      that they have a valid e-mail address. If you have the auto-approve option 
      enabled, their submission will be added to the current database and the 
      main TGP page upon visiting the confirmation link. If you are not using 
      the auto-approve option, the submission will be added to the queue where 
      you will be able to review the submission before displaying it on your 
      TGP. <BR><BR><B>Auto-Approve</B> <BR><BR>If you have the auto-approve 
      option enabled, there will be no opportunity for you to review submissions 
      before they are added to your TGP. All submissions will be automatically 
      approved once they have been received, or after the confirmation link has 
      been visited if you are using the e-mail confirmation option. If you want 
      to be able to review all submissions before displaying them, you should 
      not use the auto-approve option. <BR><BR><B>Maximum Posts Per Day</B> 
      <BR><BR>The maximum posts per day function uses the submitter's IP 
      address, website URL, and e-mail address to limit the number they can 
      submit. If the software matches on any of those, and the total number of 
      matches exceeds the number you have entered, the webmaster will not be 
      able to submit any more galleries until the date changes. 
      <BR><BR><B>Permanent and Temporary Galleries</B> <BR><BR>When webmaster's 
      submit their galleries they will have the option to choose if their 
      gallery will be temporary or permanent. Permanent galleries are those 
      which they plan to leave on the server for a long period of time, and are 
      the only submissions that the software will move into the archives. 
      Temporary galleries are considered short term, and will not be placed in 
      the archives. Once their run on the main TGP page is up, they will be 
      removed from all databases. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      software allows you to add partner accounts to the system. Partners are 
      webmasters who you trust to make good submissions without any type of 
      review or reciprocal link checking, but the software will still check for 
      banned HTML. You should only give partner accounts to webmasters that you 
      trust - you will not have any chance to review these submissions before 
      they appear on your TGP. <BR><BR>Partner accounts can be added through the 
      administrative interface. Once a partner account is created, they will be 
      able to submit their galleries through the partner.cgi interface. You can 
      link to that page with any type of standard HTML link. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      software has an optional feature which will allow you to keep older 
      submissions, while not displaying them on your main TGP page. For each 
      category that you have an archive page will be created, and the page will 
      be named based on the category. The archive pages will only display 
      submissions once they have been rotated off your main TGP page. When you 
      first start running your TGP, the archives will not have any submissions 
      listed on them. The software will maintain the size of your archives, and 
      remove the oldest galleries first. <BR><BR><B>Archive Page Naming</B> 
      <BR><BR>Each of your category archive pages will be named based on the 
      category and file extension entered in setup.cgi. The software will take 
      the category name, remove all non-alphanumeric characters, make all 
      letters lowercase, and attach the file extension. We'll give a few 
      examples so you can see how they will be named. In these examples, we will 
      assume 'html' was entered for the file extension in setup.cgi. </FONT><PRE>Category         HTML Name

      the auto-approve option, you have the ability to set the minimum time 
      interval to elapse before your TGP pages automatically update. If you have 
      the auto-update interval set to 3600 this means that each time a 
      submission is made the software will check how long it has been since your 
      TGP pages were last updated. If it has been 3600 seconds (one hour) <I>or 
      more</I>, the software will automatically rebuild all of your TGP pages 
      for you. Note that this feature requires that you have a steady stream of 
      submissions. If you want the software to auto-update every hour, you will 
      need at least one submission per hour. <BR><BR>It is recommended that you 
      have at least a 10 minute (600 seconds) auto-update interval to protect 
      your server from being overloaded. Rebuilding all of your pages can use 
      significant server resources for a short period of time. If for some 
      reason you had 100 submissions all come in at once, it could potentially 
      overload your server if it had to rebuild those pages many times. 
      <BR><BR>If you want all submissions to be automatically approved, but you 
      want to manually rebuild your TGP pages each day at a specified time, set 
      the auto-update interval to -1 (negative one). This will tell the software 
      that it should never auto-update your TGP pages. You will need to remember 
      to login to the administrative interface every so often and run the 
      Rebuild All Pages function to make sure your pages are updated. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      blacklist is a list of items that you do not want to be posted to your 
      TGP. There is a blacklist for e-mail addresses, URLs, IP addresses, and 
      words. If you have found that someone is posting bogus galleries, you can 
      blacklist their URL, e-mail address, or IP address. If there are certain 
      words that you do not want to appear on your site, you can ban those from 
      the gallery descriptions. <BR><BR>With the e-mail and URL bans, it is 
      possible to block an entire domain, or an exact URL or address. For 
      example, if you want to ban all people using Hotmail e-mail addresses from 
      posting, you should add 'hotmail.com' to the e-mail blacklist. If you only 
      want to ban John Doe, you would add 'john_doe@hotmail.com' to the 
      blacklist - this will allow others from hotmail.com to continue posting.

      viewed from admin.cgi. You will need to decide if the surfer has correctly 
      identified a bad site or not, and you can then process that cheat. If you 
      select the 'Do Nothing' option, the cheat report will be removed from the 
      database and the post will remain. If you choose to 'Delete &amp; Ban', 
      the selected post will be deleted and the domain name and e-mail address 
      from which it was posted will be added to the ban lists; the cheat report

      software offers three different methods to determine the number of 
      submissions that should be displayed on your main page. <BR><BR>The first, 
      and most simple, is the Most Recent Posts option. With this, the software 
      will simply display the x most recent submissions in the database on your 
      main TGP page, where x is the number you entered in the setup.cgi 
      interface. If you entered say 100 for that value, the software will show 
      at most 100 submissions on your TGP page. Once that number has been 
      reached, the oldest submissions will be moved into the archives if you 
      have them enabled. <BR><BR>The second option is to display the Most Recent 
      Posts Per Category. With this option, the number of galleries displayed on 
      your main TGP page will depend on how many categories you have. If you 
      have 10 categories and tell the software to display the 15 most recent 
      posts per category, you will have at most 150 galleries on your main page. 
      Once a category has more than 15 submissions, the oldest in that category 
      will be moved into the archives. <BR><BR>The final option is to display 
      the Most Recent Days Worth of Posts. With this option, the number of 
      galleries displayed on your main TGP page will be controlled by the 
      template you use for that page. More details on this option will be coming 
      soon. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
