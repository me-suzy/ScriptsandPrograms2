      following steps will guide you through the process of converting from 
      AutoGallery Pro to AutoGallery SQL. You should allow at least 30 minutes 
      for this conversion process. The instructions below apply only to 
      AutoGallery Pro v2.0.x. Your TGP page HTML can be imported, however all 
      templates for post.cgi, partner.cgi and report.cgi will need to be redone. 

      <OL>
        <LI>The first thing you should do is login to your AutoGallery Pro 
        administrative interface and run the database backup function. This will 
        create a backup file which you can use to get AutoGallery Pro running 
        again if you encounter any problems with the conversion. Make sure you 
        download the backup file to your local computer in ASCII mode before 
        continuing to the next step. <BR><BR>
        <LI>You now need to upload the autogallerypro.cgi file from the 
        AutoGallery SQL distribution. Upload this file to the directory where 
        AutoGallery Pro is currently installed - the same directory where agp.pl 
        is located. Set the permissions on this file to 755, then bring it up in 
        your browser. You will be presented with a series of messages indicating 
        that your data is being imported. Once all of the lines have printed, it 
        will tell you to continue with the next step. <BR><BR>
        <LI>After running the autogallerypro.cgi script, two files will be 
        created in your data directory. They will be named agp-html.txt and 
        agp-sql.txt. Download both of these files to your local computer in 
        ASCII mode - they will be used later to complete the data import 
        process. <BR><BR>
        <LI>If you will be installing AutoGallery SQL in a new directory, you 
        can skip this step. Otherwise, if you are installing in the same 
        directory where AutoGallery Pro is currently located, continue with this 
        step. <BR><BR>You should now completely delete your AutoGallery Pro 
        installation from your server. Delete all of the files and folders from 
        your server - if you miss any files it can cause the conversion to not 
        work properly. Be sure to get the .htaccess and .htpasswd files from the 
        admin directory, all the files and directories in the data directory, 
        and all templates in the templates directory. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Follow the instructions in the install.html documentation file to 
        install a clean copy of AutoGallery SQL on your server. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Once the installation has been completed, upload the agp-html.txt 
        and agp-sql.txt files to your AutoGallery SQL data directory. Both of 
        these files must be uploaded in ASCII mode. <BR><BR>
        <LI>The final step is to run the database restore function from the 
        administrative interface. When you do, be sure to enter agp-html.txt as 
        the HTML backup filename and agp-sql.txt as the SQL backup filename. 
        Once you have run this function, your upgrade is complete. You will now 
        need to setup your post.cgi, partner.cgi, and report.cgi template files 
        - remember you cannot use the template files from AutoGallery Pro.
