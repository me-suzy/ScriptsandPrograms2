      face=Arial size=2><BR>The sorting strings are what you will use so that 
      the posts are displayed in the order you want them. You will have complete 
      control over this string, so it gives you a lot of flexibility. To change 
      your sorting string, just edit the Extra Sorting Options field of the 
      setup.cgi interface. If you leave this field blank, the software will 
      default to 'time DESC' for the sorting string. <BR><BR><B>Fields</B> 
      <BR><BR>The fields which you can sort the posts by are listed below. 
      <BR><BR>Rating - this is the moderator rating for the post<BR>Approve_Date 
      - this is the date and time (down to the second) when the post was 
      approved<BR>Num_Pics - this is the number of pics in the gallery 
      <BR><BR>Each of these fields can also have a modifier. The modifier DESC 
      tells the software to sort in descending order. If this modifier is left 
      off, then the sorting will be done in ascending order. 
      <BR><BR><B>Examples</B> <BR><BR>
      <UL>
        <LI>Approve_Date DESC <BR><BR>This string will sort the submissions by 
        the date and time they were approved. Newests posts will be displayed 
        before older posts. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Rating DESC, Approve_Date DESC <BR><BR>This string will sort the 
        submissions first by their rating, then by their approval date and time. 
        If two posts have the same rating, the newer post will be displayed 
        first. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Num_Pics DESC <BR><BR>This string will sort the submissions by the 
        number of pics on the gallery Posts with the most pics will be listed at 
        the top. <BR><BR></LI></UL><B>How they affect output</B> <BR><BR>Using the 
      sorting strings will affect which galleries go in which slots on your TGP 
      page template. If you are using 'Rating DESC' as your sorting string, the 
      highest rated gallery will be placed in the #%GALLERY_1%# slot. If you are 
      using 'Approve_Date DESC', the newest gallery will go in that slot.
