      face=Arial size=2>This document will describe how to process your posts in 
      the queue, and what all happens when a post is processed. Below is an 
      image of what the queue page will look like when you go to approve posts. 
      There will be three checkboxes for each post, one to approve or select the 
      post, one to reject the post and one to blacklist the post. Each of those 
      will be discussed below. <BR><BR>
      <DIV align=center><IMG alt=Queue 
      src="AutoGallery SQL v2_1_x_files/queue.gif" border=1> 
      </DIV><BR><BR><B>Approve/Select</B> <BR><BR>This checkbox has a dual 
      purpose. If you are in the process of approving posts, it can be used to 
      select which posts you want to approve. If you want to e-mail or edit the 
      selected posts, this checkbox is used to select which posts to perform 
      that action on. <BR><BR>To approve posts, just check the approve box next 
      to each post you want to approve, then scroll down to the bottom of the 
      page. Select the Process Selected Posts function, and press the Execute 
      Function button. Each post will be e-mailed the contents of 
      _email_approved.etmpl if they selected to be e-mailed when their post was 
      processed. <BR><BR>To e-mail or edit posts, just check the approve box 
      next to each post you want to e-mail or edit, then scroll down to the 
      bottom of the page. Select the appropriate function from the drop down 
      menu, then press the Execute Function button. You can edit or e-mail 
      several posts all at once by putting a check in each approve box of the 
      posts you want to e-mail or edit. <BR><BR><B>Reject</B> <BR><BR>To reject 
      a post, just check the reject box next to each of the posts you want to 
      reject, then scroll down to the bottom of the page. Select the Process 
      Selected Posts function, and press the Execute Function button. If you 
      want to e-mail a customized rejection message to any of the posts, be sure 
      to select it from the drop down list before you process the posts. If you 
      leave it set to "None", no e-mail will be sent. <BR><BR><B>Blacklist</B> 
      <BR><BR>To blacklist a post, just check the blacklist box next to each of 
      the posts you want to blacklist, then scroll down to the bottom of the 
      page. Select the Process Selected Posts function, and press the Execute 
      Function button. For each of these posts, the domain from the gallery URL 
      and the submitter's e-mail address will be added to your blacklist. 
      <BR><BR><B>Moderator Rating</B> <BR><BR>This field is used to enter a 
      rating for each post. You can enter any whole number ( 1, 18, 823, etc ) 
      in this field, and it is up to you wether a high number is better than a 
      low number or vice versa. If you have entered a sorting string in 
      setup.cgi that sorts based on the rate field of a submission, the 
      moderator rating will be useful to you. If you are not doing any sorting 
      by rating, you can ignore this field, as it will have no affect on how 
      your posts are displayed. <BR><BR>If you have "rate DESC" in your sort 
      string, higher numbers will produce a higher position in the list of 
      galleries when they are displayed. If you only have "rate" or "rate ASC" 
      in your sort string, lower numbers will produce a higher position. 
      <BR><BR>So what's the point of a moderator rating? Well, you could give a 
      better rating to those posts who give you a good reciprocal link. This 
      will cause them to be displayed above the other submissions. In setup.cgi 
      you can also enter a default rating for partner posts, so all of your 
      partners will come before the general submissions. This is good for link 
      trades and things of that nature. <BR><BR><B>Approval Date</B> <BR><BR>The 
      software allows you to set the approval date that will be assigned to the 
      submissions you are working with. The approval date is what will be shown 
      on the TGP page next to the gallery (if you are using that template 
      value). This can be useful if you want to approve your submissions for the 
      next day's listing. Once all of the submissions you want have been 
      processed, you can wait until the next day to rebuild your pages. When you 
      do, the date provided in the Approval Date field will show. The only thing 
      to note about the approval date is that it must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
      <BR><BR><B>Other Information</B> <BR><BR>Approving, Rejecting, and 
      Blacklisting can all be done at the same time. Just go through your list 
      of posts, and put the check in the appropriate box for the action you want 
      to perform on each post. Once you have them all selected they way you 
      want, use the Process Selected Posts function to take care of them. 
      <BR><BR>If you should accidentally check more than one box for a post, the 
      actions are performed in the following order: blacklist, reject, approve. 
      So, say you checked both approve and reject for a post - that post would 
      be rejected. If you selected reject and blacklist, that post would be 
      blacklisted. <BR><BR>The three checkboxes at the top of the page in the 
      darker grey row can be used to select all of the checkboxes below it. For 
      example, if you wanted to approve all of the submissions on the page you 
      are viewing, you can check the box above the first A box and all of the A 
      boxes will then be checked. Note that this will only work if you have a 
      JavaScript enabled browser.
