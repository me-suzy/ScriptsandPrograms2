      face=Arial size=2>Before you begin working with cron, it is imparitive 
      that you have at least a basic understanding of several concepts, and have 
      the proper access to your server. Without knowing these things, you will 
      have an extremely difficult time getting the cron scripts to work 
      properly. <BR><BR>Your server must allow the following: <BR><BR>- Telnet 
      or SSH access<BR>- crontab access<BR>- Ability to setup multiple cron jobs 
      <BR><BR>If you are not sure that your hosting company allows the above 
      access on their servers, contact them before you begin. You will not want 
      to spend the time getting everything configured, if you do not have the 
      proper priveleges to run the cron jobs on your server. <BR><BR>You must 
      understand each of the following: <BR><BR>- Unix commands (cd, chmod, 
      etc)<BR>- Uploading files in ASCII mode<BR>- Setting variables in perl 
      scripts<BR>- Editing ASCII text files<BR>- Full Unix directory paths<BR>- 
      Using telnet or SSH to access your server <BR><BR>If there is anything you 
      do not understand in the list above, you will need to educate yourself on 
      that item(s) before you proceed. Our tech support staff will assist you if 
      you run into problems, however we simply do not have the resources to 
      educate people about the items above. There are many tutorials available 
      on the WWW covering most of the items above. Take the time to learn about 
      them if you don't already understand them. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      entry consists of two parts - a time to run, and a command to run. 
      <BR><BR>The time to run (the first part of the entry) is broken up into 5 
      fields:<BR>1. minute of the hour <BR>2. hour of the day (on the 24 hour 
      clock) <BR>3. day of the month <BR>4. month of the year (1 = January, 2 = 
      February, etc.) <BR>5. day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, 2 = 
      Tuesday, ..., 6 = Saturday) <BR><BR><BR>A * in one of these fields 
      indicates that the job should be executed at any or every one of these, so 
      for instance a * in the month of the year field means that this task 
      should be carried out every month at the time specified in the other 
      fields. A * in the day of the week field, when there is something in the 
      day of the month field, does not mean that this task should be carried out 
      every day, but rather that it should be carried out on the appointed day 
      of the month regardless of what weekday it is. Only *s in the day of the 
      week field, and the day of the month field, and the month of the year 
      field would indicate a daily task. <BR><BR>Examples:<BR>In the examples, 
      [command] represents the full path and filename of the file you want to 
      execute. <BR><BR>The job with this time to run would run every Sunday at 
      12:20 am. <BR>20 0 * * 0 [command]<BR>This job would run at midnight on 
      any Friday the 13th. <BR>0 0 13 * 5 [command] <BR><BR>You don't have to 
      put just one time in a field. This job, for instance, would run every day 
      at 12:30am, 2:30am, 4:30am, 6:30am, 6:30pm, 8:30pm, and 10:30pm: <BR>30 
      0,2,4,6,18,20,22 * * * [command] <BR><BR>This one would run every Tuesday 
      and Friday at 5:30 am: <BR>30 5 * * 2,5 [command] <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

              </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><!-- END HEADER --><BR>To 
      get started you will need to edit the cron.cgi file included with the 
      AutoGallery SQL distribution. This file can be edited in a text file 
      editor of your choice. Locate the line that looks like the following: 
      <BR><BR>$CDIR = '/home/soft/cgi-bin/ags'; <BR><BR>You will need to change 
      this variable so that it points to the full path to the directory where 
      you have installed the software. You only need to edit the portion inside 
      the single quotes. Once you have setup the correct directory path, you can 
      save this file. Note that if perl is not located at /usr/bin/perl on your 
      server, you will need to adjust the first line of this file to point to 
      the correct location of perl on your server. <BR><BR>Next you need to open 
      the sample cronfile included with the software distribution. The default 
      setup has the script rebuilding the TGP pages at 8am daily. If you want it 
      to run at different time than this, you will need to adjust the entries 
      according to the information provided above. <BR><BR>Next you will need to 
      change the following portion of each command: <BR><BR>/path/to/cron.cgi 
      <BR><BR>This will need to be changed so that it points to the cron.cgi 
      file on your server. If you have any other cron jobs running on your 
      server, make sure to include those in the cronfile as well. <BR><BR>Once 
      your cronfile is setup how you want it, you can save that file. Now you 
      need to upload these two files to your server. They should be uploaded in 
      ASCII mode to the same directory where the cgiworks.pm and ags.pl files 
      are located. Once uploaded, change the permissions on the cron.cgi file to 
      755. <BR><BR>Now you need to telnet (or SSH) into your server, and change 
      into the directory where you have uploaded cronfile. Once in that 
      directory, issue the following command: <BR><BR>crontab cronfile 
      <BR><BR>This will enter all of the commands in cronfile, and the server 
      will begin executing them at the selected times. To double check your 
      crontab entries, you can issue the following command (note the character 
      following the - is a lower case L): <BR><BR>crontab -l <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      test your setup, you will need to login to your server via telnet or SSH. 
      Once logged in, make sure you are not in the directory where the cron.cgi 
      file is located. Copy the full command from the cronfile you are using, 
      but do not include the time settings. For example if your cronfile looks 
      like this: <BR><BR>0 6 * * * /home/soft/cgi-bin/ags/cron.cgi <BR><BR>You 
      would run the following command: <BR><BR>/home/soft/cgi-bin/ags/cron.cgi 
      <BR><BR>Running this command should result in no output, and return you 
      directly to the command prompt. You can then view your TGP pages to check 
      the last updated time (use the #%LAST_UPDATE%# template value in your TGP 
      page template to display it) to make sure they were updated correctly.
