      import galleries from a text file. The text file containing your galleries 
      will need to be properly setup in order to import galleries from it, and 
      this document will explain all of the necessary steps. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      gallery importer can read galleries only from standard text files. The 
      text file should have one gallery per line, and each line should contain a 
      delimited string with all of the information for one gallery. An <A 
      href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/owners/ags/bdocs/example.txt">example import 
      file</A> is available for you to view, and your files should have a 
      similar format. <BR><BR>In the example file, each value is delimited by a 
      | character. We recommend using that character, as it is not often found 
      in everyday use. You can, however, use any character you want to delimit 
      the fields in each line. Just make sure that the character you choose 
      appears only as a delimiter - if it appears elsewhere in the string the 
      software will not be able to tell the difference. <BR><BR>We will be using 
      the first line of the sample file as an example: <BR><BR><FONT 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11px" 
      face=Arial>15|example@email.com|Amateur|http://www14.smutserver.com/teen/eryg/0823/24hztetlme.html|Young 
      amateur! </FONT><BR><BR>If you separate this string into pieces based on 
      the | character, you will find that there are 5 bits of data: 
      <BR><BR><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11px" 
      face=Arial>15<BR>example@email.com<BR>Amateur<BR>http://www14.smutserver.com/teen/eryg/0823/24hztetlme.html<BR>Young 
      amateur! </FONT><BR><BR>Each of the pieces represents one bit of 
      information about the gallery. Your file can have these pieces in any 
      order, they do not need to be in the same order as the sample file. 
      However, each line of the file must have the pieces in the same order. 
      Once you have a file that is properly formatted, you can continue on to 
      the next section for details on using the gallery importer. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      begin with, you will need to upload your text file. Make sure you upload 
      in ASCII mode, and place the file in the data directory of your 
      AutoGallery SQL installation. <BR><BR>In the administrative interface 
      select the Import Galleries function from the first drop down menu. This 
      will bring you to a page where you can enter the name of your text file 
      and the delimiting character. Enter the name of the file you just 
      uploaded, and the character used to delimit the fields. Once you have done 
      that you can press the analyze file button. <BR><BR>The software will pull 
      the first line from the file to see what data it can find. It will 
      separate out the data based on the delimiting character you provided, and 
      then display a page with the data it has found. On this page, you will 
      need to identify what each field's type is. <BR><BR><IMG 
      src="Importing Galleries_files/import.gif" border=1> <BR><BR>From the drop 
      down menus you will need to select the type of each field. If there is a 
      field in your file that does not match up with any of the allowed types, 
      select the IGNORE option and the software will ignore that field. Once you 
      have selected the type for each field, you will need to decide whether you 
      want these galleries to go in the queue or current database. Select the 
      option you want, and then press the import galleries button. <BR><BR>Once 
      completed, you will be returned to the main administrative page, and a 
      count of the number of imported galleries will be listed at the top of the 
      page. We recommend that you limit your imports to 1000 galleries per file. 
      Many servers place a time limit on the execution time of CGI scripts, and 
      trying to import too many galleries may result in a timeout in the middle 
      of the process. <BR><BR><!-- HEADER -->

      are not provided, the software will use the current date when importing.
