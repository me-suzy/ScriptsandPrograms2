      face=Arial size=2>These instructions are for upgrading from AutoGallery 
      SQL v2.0.0 only. 
      <OL>
        <LI>The first thing you should do is login to your AutoGallery SQL 
        administrative interface and run the database backup function. This will 
        create two backup files which you can use to get AutoGallery SQL running 
        again if you encounter any problems with the conversion. Make sure you 
        download the backup files to your local computer in ASCII mode before 
        continuing to the next step. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Upload the autogallerysql.cgi file from the v2.1.x distribution to 
        the directory on your server where AutoGallery SQL is currently 
        installed, and the tables.dat file to the data directory of your current 
        AutoGallery SQL installation. Make sure you upload in ASCII mode and 
        change the permissions on the autogallerysql.cgi file to 755. You can 
        now point your browser to this file, and it will convert your MySQL 
        database to the new format. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Edit the ags.pl file included with the 2.1.x distribution and setup 
        the MySQL username, password, and database name. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Next you can upload all of the files from the v2.0.x distribution to 
        your server in the corresponding folders. Complete details on what 
        folders each file goes into and file permissions can be found in the 
        install.html documentation file. Files you <I>do not</I> need to upload 
        are: <BR><BR><B>In the templates directory</B><BR>All _post_*.htmlt 
        files<BR>All _partner_*.htmlt files<BR>All _email_*.etmpl files<BR>All 
        _report_*.htmlt files<BR><BR>All other files need to be uploaded. 
        <B><FONT color=red>Make sure you upload all of the other files, 
        including the _admin_*.htmlt and _extern_*.htmlt templates. Failure to 
        upload the new files will result in the software not functioning 
        correctly</FONT></B> <BR><BR>
        <LI>Log into your administrative interface and click on the Edit 
        Variables and Options link. You will need to go through and make sure 
        all of the setup options are how you want them. If you are using a 
        custom sorting string, it will need to be changed. See the display.html 
        documentation for the new sorting values. Once you have done this, the 
        upgrade is complete.
