        <LI>At this point it is assumed you have extracted the archive 
        containing AutoGallery SQL. If you have not yet done so, you should do 
        that now. <BR><BR>You should also have the following information on 
        hand: <BR><BR>- The name of the MySQL database which you will be using 
        to store the data<FONT face=Verdana color=red size=2>*</FONT><BR>- The 
        username which you use to access the MySQL database<BR>- The password 
        which you use to access the MySQL database <BR><BR>If you do not have 
        this information, contact your server administrator to get it. 
        <BR><BR><FONT face=Verdana color=red size=2>*</FONT> This name is not 
        something you can just make up. The database must be created by your 
        server administrator in order for you to use it. If you don't know the 
        name of a database which you are allowed to use, contact your server 
        administrator to get that information or to have them create a database 
        for you. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Now you will want to locate Perl 5 on your server. If you are not 
        sure where to find it, contact your server administrator and ask them. 
        Generally it can be found at /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl 
        <BR><BR>
        <LI>If Perl 5 is located at /usr/bin/perl on your server, you may skip 
        this step. If it is not, you will need to open each of the .cgi files in 
        a text editor such as Notepad. Change the first line of each file to 
        point to Perl 5 on your server. For example, if Perl 5 is at 
        /usr/local/bin/perl, then the first line will be #!/usr/local/bin/perl 
        <BR><BR>
        <LI>You will now need to login to your server and create some 
        directories for AutoGallery SQL. First off, decide where you want the 
        .cgi files installed. Generally it is a good idea to keep them in a 
        cgi-bin (or equivalent) directory. Once you have decided where you want 
        the .cgi files, change into that directory. Inside that directory you 
        will need to create 3 subdirectories; name them templates, data, and 
        admin. <B>Note:</B> The only files you should place in these directories 
        are the ones indicated in this documentation. Uploading other files can 
        and will cause problems. <BR><BR>Now, you need to decide where you want 
        the HTML files written to. This will need to be outside of the cgi-bin 
        directory. Once you have decided where you want them to go, record that 
        information for later use. <BR><BR><B>Example Directory Structure:</B>

        <LI>You now need to edit the .htaccess file from the admin directory of 
        the archive. This is the file that will enable the password protection 
        of the admin directory once it is on your server. A description of what 
        needs to be edited and how to do it can be found in the .htaccess file. 
        This file should be edited in a text editor. <BR><BR>
        <LI>Next you need to edit the ags.pl file in a text editor. Four 
        variables need to be set in this file. <BR><BR>$DATABASE = 
        'ags';<BR>$USERNAME = 'ags';<BR>$PASSWORD = 'password';<BR>$HOSTNAME = 
        'localhost';<BR><BR><BR>These variables tell the software the name of 
        the database you are using, the username/password combination to access 
        the database server, and the hostname of the server where the database 
        is located. In most cases, you do not need to change the $HOSTNAME 
        variable - if you do not know what to use in this field, contact your 
        server administrator for assistance. <BR><BR>The remaining variables are 
        straightforward. $DATABASE is the name of the MySQL database you will be 
        using to store the data. If a database has not yet been created, contact 
        your server administrator to have them create one for you. The $USERNAME 
        variable is the username you use to login to the MySQL server, and the 
        $PASSWORD variable is the password you use to login to the MySQL server. 
        <BR><BR>Once you have made the changes, save the file and continue with 
        the next step. 
        <LI>Now you are ready to begin uploading the files to your server. 
        <B>VERY IMPORTANT:</B> You must upload <B>ALL</B> of the AutoGallery SQL 
        files in ASCII mode, or it will not function properly. If you are not 
        sure how to do this, consult the documentation for your FTP client. If 
        you get a Script Error message saying you may not have stripped the 
        carriage returns, this means you did not upload all the files in ASCII 
        mode - try again. <BR><BR>Below is a table of where each file should be 
        uploaded, using the example directory structure above: 
        <BR><BR><B>/cgi-bin/tgp</B><BR>ags.pl<BR>sql.pl<BR>cgiworks.pm<BR>http.pl<BR>init.cgi<BR>partner.cgi<BR>post.cgi<BR>report.cgi 
        <BR><BR><B>/cgi-bin/tgp/admin</B><BR>.htaccess<BR>admin.cgi<BR>extern.cgi<BR>setup.cgi 
        <BR><BR><B>/cgi-bin/tgp/data</B><BR>.htaccess<BR>def.html<BR>errors.dat<BR>lang.dat 
        <BR><BR><B>/cgi-bin/tgp/templates</B><BR>All .htmlt and .etmpl files 
        <BR><BR>
        <LI>Next, you will need to set permissions on the directories and files 
        that AutoGallery SQL will be using. If you are not sure how to set 
        permissions, consult the documentation for your FTP client and/or 
        contact your server administrator for more information. Below is a table 
        containing the permissions you will need to set on each directory or 
        file. <BR><BR>

        permissions set, continue to the next step. <BR><BR>
        <LI>You are now ready to begin the web based portion of the setup. In 
        your browser, type in the full URL to the init.cgi file on your server. 
        This will initialize the installation, and prepare the administrative 
        directory. Once you have run init.cgi, and received a message indicating 
        you may proceed, you can bring up setup.cgi in your browser. It is also 
        now safe to remove the init.cgi file from your server - it is no longer 
        needed. The default login info to access the password protected 
        administrative area is: <BR><BR>Username: admin<BR>Password: admin 
        <BR><BR>You will then be presented with a page where you will fill in 
        variables and options for the software. After you have set all of the 
        variables, click the button near the bottom of the page. If everything 
        went well, you will be presented with a page telling you that the 
        variables have been recorded, and some self tests will be done by the 
        script. If all the tests pass, you are ready to go on. If any of them 
        fail, you will need to check file permissions and directory settings. If 
        you get any error messages after you press the button, you most likely 
        have either a permissions setting wrong or one of the variables in 
        agp.pl is incorrectly set. <BR><BR>
        <LI>You should now be ready to begin using the software. The first thing 
        you will want to do is point your browser to admin.cgi. Use the same 
        login information as is listed above. <BR><BR>Once inside the admin 
        script you can start exploring the features, but make sure that you 
        change your password soon after your initial installation. This can be 
        done by selecting the Display all Moderators function from the first 
        pull down menu. Once on that page, check the box next to the admin 
        account and choose to edit it. You will then be able to see the current 
        password, and change it to whatever you want. Make sure you use a 
        password that contains a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols so 
        that it is very difficult to guess. <BR><BR>

        <BR><BR>If you have uploaded the AutoGallery SQL zip (or tar or tar.gz) 
        file to your server, remove it now. Leaving it on your server provides a 
        chance for other users to steal it from your web space. Make sure you 
        never leave a copy of the software where other people can access it. 
        <BR><BR>Never share your software with anyone. The license you purchased 
        is for your use only - you may not give the software to anyone under any 
        circumstances. If you are caught doing this, you will be charged with 
        software piracy and face fines up to $100,000. <BR><BR>Never share your 
        owners lounge username or password with anyone. Again, that is for your 
        use only. We will never ask for you to send your password to us, so if 
        you ever get an e-mail requesting it you should not send it. <BR><BR>Do 
        not upload the software documentation to your server or share it with 
        anyone. We keep the documentation in the owners lounge so only 
        legitimate customers can access it. This makes it much more difficult 
        for users of pirated software to figure out how to use it. <BR><BR>If 
        you ever find a site that is offering our software for download, please 
        contact us immediately so we can have the site shut down. Every time our

      you need any assistance with this software, you must use the resources in 
      the JMB Software owners lounge. This is the only way to contact the tech 
      support department. Use the following URL, and the login information you 
      selected when you purchased the software: <BR><BR><A class=orange 
      href="http://www.jmbsoft.com/owners/">http://www.jmbsoft.com/owners/</A> 
      <BR><BR><B><FONT color=red>Important Tech Support Notes:</FONT></B> 
      <BR><BR>If you edit the scripts in any way other than described above, you 
      will no longer be eligible for technical support. We absolutely cannot 
      provide support for edited copies of our software. <BR><BR>The only way we 
      provide support for our commercial scripts is through the owners lounge. 
      We do it this way to make sure we are providing support only to those who 
      have paid for the scripts and deserve it. If you post a message at the 
      Freeware Help Board it will be deleted - you must post on the Owners 
      Lounge board. Also, sending a plain e-mail to us will be ignored, you must 
      use the tech support request form in the Owners Lounge. <BR><BR>These 
      methods also help to ensure that we are not wasting our time providing 
      support for illegal copies of our software, and will result in faster 
      responses to legitimate owners questions. <BR><BR>Thank You, and enjoy 
      your new software! </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></FONT></BODY></HTML>
