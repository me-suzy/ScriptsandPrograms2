On some NT machines, you'll need to specify the path for your require
statements.

If a .cgi file contains a line which starts with the word require,  just above that line add:

	push (@INC, 'E:\\path-to-this-script\\cgi-bin\\echat41');

where path-to-this-script is replaced by, you guessed it, the path to the
script you're adding the line to, which should be the same for each script.
