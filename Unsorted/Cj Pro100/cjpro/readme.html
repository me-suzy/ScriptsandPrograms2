<td>CJ Pro 1.00 Is here.&nbsp; Its basically the same as 0.30 with a few
small bug fixes, and now the webmaster page has a place for your trade
partners to check their stats!&nbsp; If there are no bugs in the program
this will be the last update I'll give away for free.&nbsp; I am working
on improvements now that will allow you back up your memberfiles, and will
auto-restore them in case of dataloss so you never ever lose a trade, and
changes in the coding that will let you trade based on productivity instaed
of raw ratios, so you dont have to watch your trades.&nbsp; I am also putting
in some cheat protection.&nbsp; If you register the program with me for
$100 I will make all improvements in the code available to you for the
next year for no additional charge, and a copy of the C script for free
if I get it done by then.&nbsp; You already know I spend major time on
this script making improvements nearly every week, so Im sure you will
more than get your monies worth.&nbsp; (I will also install a version for
you that doesnt take 1% of your traffic)&nbsp; Anyway just give me a yell
on icq if youre interested.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER>Ok, I finally got another update here!&nbsp;
Its version 0.30 Beta.&nbsp; More stable platform, should handle more trades
per day than the previos version, improved the logic it uses when sending
out hits so it should trade even better, and fixed that crappy looking
webmaster page.&nbsp; If you already have an older version on your site,
all you need to do is download the entire zip and replace some of the files
with new ones. You wont lose any data or trades.&nbsp; No need to do anything
else. Complete upgrade installation instructions are at the bottom of this
page(if you need help or dont understand something, just icq me and Ill
help ya out).&nbsp; If you dont have it running on your site yet there
are complete installation instructions included in the zip file.&nbsp;
To see what the new webmaster page looks like go <a href="http://americanhoes.com/cgi-bin/cjpro/cjprowebmaster.cgi" target="_blank">here.</a></td>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>
<center>CJ Pro has become in my ever so humble opinion the best free circle
jerking script there is, with some of the same features in scripts costing
upwards of $300.&nbsp; This is the result of the countless hours of coding
I have invested in this script.&nbsp; I am not charging any money for the
script at this time, but it does send me a small amount of the traffic
it helps you to generate on your site.&nbsp; To be specific it is one percent
of the outclicks.&nbsp; Once you begin using this script, you will find
that the productivity tracking alone will increase your traffic by ten
times the amount it is sending to me.&nbsp; Because I have invested so
much of my time in this product, and since I am offering it up to you without
asking for cash payment, I do insist that you DO NOT remove the account
cjpro, edit ANY of the code, or redistrubute the code.&nbsp; The code will
always be available at this address, if you know someone who wants the
scirpt send them here, don't give em a copy of yours.&nbsp; This will allow
me to make sure they have the most recent version, and give them the opportunity
to read my terms and conditions.&nbsp; I dont believe this is too much
to ask.&nbsp; If you cant live with the loss of one percent of your traffic
just contact me and&nbsp; I will be more than happy to hook you up with
an improved version of the script, including database backup, automatic
restore of the database in case of loss, error logging to the admin,, and
that will also give you the ability to create perm links and groups, plus
many other updates I plan to make in the near future for free.&nbsp; In
exchange for this I will ask for a modest fee for the time I have invested.
Fair is Fair, after all.&nbsp;
<br>By Using This Script You Agree To The Following
<p>1. You will not edit or modify any of the code or text in any of the
CJ Pro files
<br>2. You will not distribute, in portion or whole, any code or text in
any of the CJ Pro files
<br>3. You will only use this software on pages displaying legal adult
content
<br>4. You agree to periodically check this page for any further posted
rules, limitations, or restrictions
<br>5. You agree that you will abide be any further posted rules, limitation,
or restrictions</center>

<p>This script is designed to allow you to very easily manage traffic trades
on an adult circle jerking site.&nbsp; I did not write this script for
use on non adult sites, nor are you authorized to use this software on
non adult sites, ONLY SITES WITH <b>LEGAL ADULT CONTENT</b></td>

Jerking 101</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>Circle jerking was basically named such because the surfer
is jerked around from site to site, in search of the free porn that is
promised, but rarely delivered, and as such has gotten quite a bad name
in the industry.&nbsp; Every time the surfer clicks hoping to get another
free pic more and more circle jerk sites open in his browser.&nbsp; The
purpose of a cirlce jerk then is to get surfer joe to click as many times
as possible on your site before he gives up and closes all the circle jerk
sites hes got open in his browser.&nbsp; So whats the point?&nbsp; Surfer
joe will get frustrated during his search for free porn, and eventually
he'll whip out the plastic and join a paysite (hopefully one youre offering
up to him) or he'll download and use your dialer (which you'll also make
money from).
<br>There are many tricks of the trade to get the surfer to click during
his visit to your site, and some of them are considered cheating by other
webmasters.&nbsp; Remeber that is called a circle jerk for a reason, surfer
joe travels from site to site.&nbsp; If other webmasters believe you are
using what they believe to be dishonest or underhanded ways of sending
the surfer to their site from yours they will not only refuse to trade
any traffic with you, but will also notify all other webmasters of your
activities.&nbsp; I strongly urge you to visit all of the circle jerk webmaster
information pages whos links are at the bottom of this page and become
thoroughly familiar with the rules of the game before you begin using this
script, or any other circle jerking script.&nbsp; Once your reputation
is lost, youll never get it back, so it's to your advantage to know the
rules of the game before you begin playing, and besides, you will get some
very useful information and ideas from these sites as well.</td>

<p>All you need to do is download the entire zip file cjpro100.zip using
the link at the top of the page.&nbsp; Extract the cjprorecalculte.cgi,
cjproadmin.cgi, and cjprowebmaster.cgi.&nbsp; Upload those three files,
overwriting the old ones on your server.&nbsp; Thats is, you're ready to
go.
<br>Note that there was a bug in version 0.20 and 0.21 that caused the
script to forget the passwords for your trade partners, so you may have
to go into the admin and edit your partners to assign a password to each
of them if the password field is blank.&nbsp; If you dont do this they
just wont be able to check their stats.
<br>&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>
<center>Upgrading to version 1.00 from 0.20, 0.21, or 0.21b</center>

<p>Download the current version from the link at the top of the page, you
wont be needing to do a complete install again, you only need a few of
the files.&nbsp; You will not lose any data, or any trades, just load,
chmod, and the script will contrinue trading with your current trade partners,
but with better performance.&nbsp; 0.30 has several improvements in many
of the files that help it run faster and more efficiently.&nbsp; You will
need to upload the following files from the zip to their respective directories
<br>upload to the cjpro root directory and chmod them all to 755
<br>cjproadmin.cgi
<br>cjproin.cgi
<br>cjproout.cgi
<br>cjproprinttop.cgi
<br>cjprowebmaster.cgi
<br>cjprorecalculate.cgi
<br>Note that you do NOT need to upload the cjproconfigure.cgi, and your
install will be MUCH easier if you dont upload this file
<p>now upload the following files to you cjpro/datafiles directory and
chmod them all to 755
<br>rules.dat
<br>rules2.dat
<p>now upload the following file to the cjpro/memberfiles directory and
chmod it to 777
<br>auxout.dat

common mistake.
<br>Anyway, thats about it.&nbsp; If it doesn't work by now look in the
common problems section below.
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>A few things you should know before you mess around in the admin too
much
<p>1.&nbsp; To change the URL that the extra hits are sent to edit the
cjprosetup.cgi file directly, DO NOT edit it in the admin.&nbsp; You can
view the file in the admin, just dont try to change anything in the file.
<br>2. This script tracks productivity, that is the amount of times on
average that a surefer clicks on your page.&nbsp; The productivity is shown
as a total, and broken down by what site the surfer came from.&nbsp; If
the prodcutvity is low, its probably a bad trade.
<br>3.&nbsp; The force amount is the amount of hits the scirpt will send
to that site at the time specified by force time.&nbsp; This feature is
used for hitting toplists, or keeping trades alive.
<br>4.&nbsp; If you have never ran a circle jerk before, i recommend you
visit all of the sites in the links section to get a good idea of what
i a ciricle jerk is, adn teh rules to follow.&nbsp; Im not going to list
them here, but I do expect you to visit the sites in my links page before
you use the scirpt.&nbsp; Trust me, they are good sites with good information,
well worth the time.
<p>Thats it, you should be ready to start circle jerking as soon as you
get some traffic to your site and find a few trade partners to swap surfers
with.&nbsp; Dont forget to hit me up for a trade as well ICQ 4885653 /
Banzai.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p>If you can not get the script to work, heres some helpful (and some
not so helpful) tips.
<p>Problem:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You recieve a 500 error when you surf to the cjproadmin.cgi
file
<br>Possible Causes:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check this line in the cjproconfigure file&nbsp;
$email = "you\@yourhost.com";&nbsp; (your email address between the quotes)&nbsp;
There should be a '\' just before the '@'.&nbsp; If not add it now.&nbsp;
I know when you do that its no longer a valid email address, but trust
me it WILL display correctly and function correctly when the script processes
it.&nbsp; You must do this because of the way perl handles the '@' symbol.&nbsp;
Remember it is a '\' symbol and NOT a '/' symbol.
<p>Problem:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everytime you surf to cjproout.cgi the script sends
you to the url you set for $auxout in the cjproconfigure.cgi file.
<br>Possible Causes:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a surfer has been to a partners site, the script
will not send them back to that site again, untill whatever time period
you set in cjproconfigure is up.&nbsp; I.E.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the surfer
has visited all the sites you owe hits to the script will send them to
the url you set $auxout to each and everytime.&nbsp; You just need more
sites to trade with.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
