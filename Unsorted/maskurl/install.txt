PerlCoders MaskURL Installation Documentation
-----------------------------------------------

1] Preparing Installation
-------------------------

Unzip the file containing the MaskURL script to a directory 
and make sure to extract with directories. You should now
see the following directory structure:

[ extraction path ]
|
new.cgi	
|
admin.cgi
|
mask.cgi
|
account.cgi
|
+- doc/
|
+- tools/
|
+- templates/
   |
   +- admin
   |
   +- new
   |
   +- account

Now go into the doc/ director and read the install.txt document
(which you are doing right now). Depending on your webserver
different methods of installation are needed, they are all
covered below.

MaskURL uses the MySQL database system to store information, so you
will have to create a database. You can use the 'install-db.sh' script for
this which you can find in the 'tools' directory/ -- to run this script
you will need to have 'create' and 'grant' permission on the database.

If you can't create the database yourself, you can send an e-mail to
your administrator. Please include the install-db script and ask the
administrator to return to you the database name, the database server,
the user name and the password to use.


2] Configuring MaskURL
----------------------

Before uploading anything, copy doc/example.conf to maskurl.conf and place it
in the same directory as the .cgi files. Then edit the configuration. 

Enter the correct values for the dbserver, dbname, dbuser and dbpass settings.

Also edit the templates found in the 'templates/new' and 'templates/account'
directories to your own liking but *make sure* all the <form> tags and all the
<input> tags REMAIN THE SAME. Including the % codes found in those fields.


3] Uploading
------------

Upload all the .cgi files to your server in ASCII mode, and make sure to
set the right mode (755) on them. Also upload the entire 'templates' directory
and place that directory in the same directory as the cgi scripts.


4] Configuring your webserver
-----------------------------

4.1] Standard Configuration for Apache
--------------------------------------

To use the MaskURL package, you have to put the included apache-htaccess
file in the directory you want to use for the masking. E.g. if you want to
have http://myhost.com/mask/<username> as the masking URL, put the apache-htaccess
in the 'mask' directory in your documentroot as .htaccess. Then edit this file
and point it to the right path for the mask.cgi

Installation is now complete.

4.2] Standard Configuration for Roxen Challenger
------------------------------------------------

To use the MaskURL package, ask your administrator to add the Redirect v2.0 module
to your virtual server (if it hasn't already been done) and ask him to include
the following RegExp in the Redirection table:

/mask/(.*) 	/cgi-bin/maskurl/mask.cgi?$1

Replace "mask" with the correct directory you want to mask from (see Standard
Apache Installation) and /cgi-bin/maskurl.. etc. with the correct path to
your mask.cgi

Installation is now complete

4.3] Member Site Installation
-----------------------------

If you run a site where members have to pay to get access to various services
and you want to offer MaskURL as a service, you have to take a few special steps.
Installation is as above, but place the account.cgi and new.cgi inside your
members area. Be sure to point the scripturl to this location as well. Be sure
to place the mask.cgi *outside* any password protected area. Now proceed
with the installation as above (4.1/4.2).


5] Maintenance
--------------

Using the admin.cgi script you can delete users and edit their details. You
can also modify the configuration from here.
