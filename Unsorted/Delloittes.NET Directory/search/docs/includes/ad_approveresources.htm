<p>To ensure only relevant screened content is submitted to the directory, all submissions must first be approved by a directory editor. All resources pending approval are displayed on the approve resources page. You have a number of options available when approving links. Resources with duplicate URLs are highlighted on this approval page.<br><br>

<b>Edit & Approve</b><br><br> 

The Edit and Approve option allows you to modify any part of the submission before approval as well as mark the submission as a sponsor or favourite to increase exposure of a particular item within the directory. Using the Edit & Approve option you can also move a submission to a new or more suitable category before it is live for your visitors. Sponsored listings always receive higher rankings within related categories or search results.<br><br>

<b>Just Approve</b><br><br>

Just Approve allows you to approve resources instantly if you are happy with the information and chosen category. This option is not available if the resource has no associated category. You must select an appropriate category using "Edit & Approve". <br><br>

<b>Delete Resource</b><br><br>

You can remove resources from the database if they are not relevant to the directory. A confirmation screen is provided to ensure resources are not accidentally deleted.<br><br>

<H2 class=dtH2>Related Information</H2>

<p>When a submission is approved, all associated category count information is automatically incremented by one. This category count information provides a useful insight to your users as to how many items are within a category.<br><br>
