<img src="images/related.gif" align="right" hspace="10">The "Related Resource" features provides an easy way to cross-reference listings within the directory. The idea behind the related resource link is simple. <br><br>

For each resource we construct a related resource link. This passes each resources title into the directory search engine which then removes any duplicate keywords and performs keyword filtering on the resource title. The results are presented based on the keywords the search engine deemed relevant.<br><br>

This feature may not work for every resource within the directory. For example if a resource has a long descriptive title and the search engine is presented with finding 8-9 matching keywords within other resources, the chance of find related resources with all these keywords narrows. This feature is only limited by the scale and range of subjects covered within your directory.
