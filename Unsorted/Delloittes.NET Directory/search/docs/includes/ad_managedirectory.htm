<H2 class=dtH2><img src="images/cats.gif" align="absmiddle"> Manage Directory</H2>

<p>The Manage Directory pages provide all the features needed to organise, maintain and control your directory. You are presented with a replica view of your directory with administration features to help maintain your directory. You can modify, move or delete any category or resource within the directory enabling complete control and manageability over the data held within the directory.<br><br>

<H2 class=dtH2>Managing Categories within the Directory</H2>

Categories are managed by using the feature icons aligned right of each category heading. Each feature icon and its functions are detailed below...<br><br>

<img src="images/modifycatname.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Modify Category Details </b><br><br>
This icon provides a quick and simple way to modify category details. You can modify a category name or specify if resources are allowed within the selected category.<br><br>

<img src="images/moveresource.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Moving Categories</b><br><br>
If you wish to move a specific category around within the directory, use this icon. Once you click the icon you will be presented with a list of categories within your directory and have the option to specify a parent category. <br><br>

<img src="images/bin.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Delete Category</b><br><br>
As the name suggests, this option allows you to delete categories within the directory. You will be provided with a confirmation screen to ensure mistakes are not made. Please remember when you delete a category this will also remove all resources within the root of this category. If the category has sub categories, these will not be deleted. Please remove any sub categories first.<br><br>

<img src="images/modify.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Modify Resource</b><br><br>
The Modify Resource icon provides instant access to a specific resource's details. You can modify all aspects of the resource including the resource title, the description, the URL, contact details and whether the resource is a favourite or sponsored listing.<br><br>

<img src="images/moveresource.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Move Resource</b><br><br>
This feature allows you to easily move resources around within the directory. Once you click this link, you will be presented with a list of all the available link categories with the option to select a new category for the resource.<br><br>

<img src="images/bin.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Delete Category</b><br><br>
