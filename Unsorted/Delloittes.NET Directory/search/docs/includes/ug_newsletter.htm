However users can subscribe and unsubscribe from the mailing list using the front-end newsletter feature.<br><br>

Users can unsubscribe at any time simply by entering their email address within the newsletter box and clicking "Unsubscribe". If a user is already subscribing to your newsletter and they try and subscribe again they will receive a prompt. If they try and unsubscribe and they are not on your mailing list they will also receive a friendly prompt.<br><br>

Providing you have administration access you can view all the subscribers to your mailing list within the administration pages. To view your mailing list click "The Mailing List" within the left navigation pane. You are also given the option to filter bad emails and remove users.
