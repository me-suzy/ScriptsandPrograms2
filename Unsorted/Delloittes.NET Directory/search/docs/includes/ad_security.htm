<p>To access the various directory administration features users must first enter a username and password into the login screen.<br><br>

When you first purchase the directory system, a default account with administration rights is already established within the database. It is highly recommended you remove this account and add an administration account using your own username and password. The username and password for the default account is listed below...<br><br>

<b>Username</b> : admin<br>
<b>Password</b> : admin<br><br>

Once you have created your personal account, you can choose to have the directory software remember your details within a cookie on your system. Tick the "Remember my username and password so it automatically fills in next time" checkbox to save your details within a cookie. Saving your details within a cookie is only recommended if you are the only user with access to your computer.<br><br>

The default IIS session timeout (usually 20 minutes) is used to determine when a user has been inactive for a period of time. If the user has been inactive for this period of time they will be automatically logged out and will need to log back in to the administration centre. <br><br>

<i>The username and password fields are not case-sensitive.
