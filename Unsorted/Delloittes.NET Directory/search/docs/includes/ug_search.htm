The deloittes.NET Directory allows users to find relevant results quickly and easily using the powerful feature-rich search engine.<br><br>

At the core of the search is an intelligent engine that removes duplicate words and filters common keywords from within any given search string. This provides more accurate search results and allows for more generalised free English query type searches.<br><br>

<b>Boolean Support</b><br><br>

<img src="images/boolean.gif" align="right" hspace="10">The deloittes.NET Directory search engine also supports Boolean searches by selecting either "ALL", "ANY" or "Exact" from the <i>Type Of Search</i> drop down. By default the directory uses the "ANY" option.<br><br>

For example, performing a search for "Big Apple" using the "ALL" option would only return results containing the full word "Big Apple". Searching for "Big Apple" with "ANY" would return results containing either the word "Big" or the word "Apple" or a combination of both. <br><br>If you wish to find exact matches within the directory, use the "Exact" option. This returns only results where the title or description exactly match your search term. Please note: keyword filtering is not performed when you do an exact search.<br><br>

<b>Narrow your searches</b><br><br>

<img src="images/searchbox1.gif" align="right" hspace="10">The deloittes.NET Directory offers the ability to narrow your searches to specific categories. You are only provided the opportunity to search specific categories if they have been created as link categories.  Please see the "Allow Links" section within the "<a href="ad_createcategory.htm">New Category</a>" administration documentation for more information regarding link categories. Root categories have no resources within them and do not offer the opportunity to search within that category.<br><Br>

<b>Search for URLs</b><br><br>

You can search for addresses within the directory by adding "link:" to the start of your search strings. For example to find all resources within the directory from the Microsoft site you could perform the following searches.<br><br>link:www.microsoft.com<br>link:http://www.microsoft.com/
