<p>To ensure only relevant screened reviews are submitted to the directory, all review submissions must first be approved by a directory editor. All reviews pending approval are displayed on the approve reviews page. You have a number of options available when approving user reviews.<br><br>

<b>Edit & Approve</b><br><br>

The Edit and Approve option allows you to modify any part of a review before final submission to the directory. This ensures no malicious, vulgar or unsubstantiated reviews will be added to the directory. This is also a great way to ensure content authors do not submit reviews for themselves in order to gain more exposure.<br><br>

<b>Just Approve</b><br><br>

Just Approve allows you to approve reviews instantly if you are happy with the information provided. <br><br>

<b>Delete Resource</b><br><br>

You can remove reviews from the database if they are not suitable. A confirmation screen is provided to ensure reviews are not accidentally deleted.<br><br>

<b>NOTE : This page is available to all directory editors.</b>
