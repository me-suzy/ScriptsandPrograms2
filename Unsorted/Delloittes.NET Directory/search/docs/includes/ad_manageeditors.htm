<p>The Manage Editors page provides detailed information about each directory editor and offers the opportunity to modify any users details.<br><br>

When you enter this page you will be presented with a list of all current directory editors. You can see when a editor was added, when they last visited, how many times they have logged on and if they have administration rights.<br><br>

You can modify any users full name, username, password and access privileges by clicking on their name within the list. You can also remove users by clicking the Delete link aligned right of each user. A confirmation screen is provided to ensure you don't accidentally delete editors.<br><br>



<b>NOTE : This page is only available to users with administration rights.</b>
