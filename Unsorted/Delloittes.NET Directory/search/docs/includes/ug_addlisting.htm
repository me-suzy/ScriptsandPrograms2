The "Add Listing" page allows your visitors to submit links for review before inclusion into the directory. Users can submit resources to specific categories by clicking "Add Listings" within a chosen category. Links can also be submitted to general root categories. These links cannot be approved right away and you will need to specify a suitable category that allows resources before approval.<br><br>

Submitting links to the directory is very simple. Users will need to provide some basic information such as resource title, resource description, resource URL and basic contact information. Users are provided with the option to save their contact details within a cookie to ease the process of future submissions.<br><br>
