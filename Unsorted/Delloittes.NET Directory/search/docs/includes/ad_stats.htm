<p>Basic directory statistics are provided within the administration navigation pane. A brief description of each statistic is presented below.<br><br>

<b>Root Categories</b><br><br>

This displays the number of root categories within the directory. A root category is a category which is not allowed link submissions and is only a container category for sub-categories.<br><br>

<b>Link Categories</b><br><br>

This is the number of categories within your directory that are allowed link submissions. These are usually topic-specific categories.<br><br>

<b>Approved Links</b><br><br>

This is the number of links that have been approved and are flagged as "publish to web" within the database.<br><br>  

<b>Links To Approve</b><br><br>

This is the number of links that are awaiting approval before they are set live.<br><br> 

<b>Reviews To Approve</b><br><br>

This is the number of resource reviews that are awaiting approval before they are set live.<br><br>

<b>Reported Errors</b><br><br>

This is the number of error report submissions that are still awaiting your attention.<br><br>

<b>Newsletter Subscribers</b><br><br>

This is the number of people subscribed to your newsletter.<br><br>

<b>Total Number Links</b><br><br>

This is the total number of link submissions within your directory. This includes both links that are awaiting approval and live links.<br><br>

<b>Total Number Categories</b><br><br>

This is the total number of categories within your directory. This includes both root categories and link categories.<br><br>

<b>Link to Category Ratio</b><br><br>

This presents the ratio of links to categories. This provides you with a balance of resources vs categories. A good link to category ratio would be around 5:1. That's, on average, 5 links within each link category. Root categories are not used within this equation.<br><br>
