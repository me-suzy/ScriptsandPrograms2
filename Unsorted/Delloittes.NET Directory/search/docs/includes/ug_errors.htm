<H2 class=dtH2>Error Reports</H2>

Maintaining a large directory of information can be a time-consuming task. Managing and checking individual resources may not be possible. The "Report Error" feature allows your visitors to submit error reports for any individual resource within your directory. Error reports can range from a user reporting an incorrect description or resource title to reporting a bad link.<br><br>

To submit an error report users must click the "Report Error" link aligned bottom left of each resource. They are then presented with a pop-up form (they never leave the main site) showing the affected resource and asked to complete a simple form asking for their name, email address, the nature of error and any comments they may wish to leave.<br><br>

The error reports are then available within the administration pages allowing you to view each resource and modify or delete accordingly. Information regarding the "Check Errors" administration page is available <a href="ad_checkerrors.htm">here</a>
