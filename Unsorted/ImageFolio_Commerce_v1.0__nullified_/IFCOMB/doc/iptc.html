        A discussion of some of the issues associated with the captioning of digital 
        images.</STRONG>

      <P>Unlike textual data whos content can be indexed and hence searched at 
      a later time, digital picture data is nothing more than a representation 
      of the pixels that make up the image. There are currently no methods - 
      beyond some purely experimental projects, to distinguish a picture of say 
      a cup from a spaceship by examining just the pixel data. Hence we 
      typically associate or 'bind' some text to a digital image file such that 
      searching for words within the bound text can locate its associated image. 
      </P>
      <P>For small quantities of image files this text association may not be 
      necessary as we can simply give each picture file a descriptive file name. 
      (Even so there are an increasing number of publishers who insist that all 
      digital pictures be supplied with a textual description.) However, this 
      method rapidly becomes impracticable as the quantity of files increases. 
      For larger quantities of files it is necessary to employ a database in 
      order to manage their archiving and retrieval. Such databases - known as 
      media archives in the above context, 'catalogue' large numbers of image 
      files by recording in lists (indexing) each word in the associated textual 
      description. </P>
      <P>For a digital picture archive whos content is used exclusively 
      'in-house' the textual description can take any form so long as sufficient 
      information is recorded for images to be successfully retrieved. But for 
      archives whos content is destined for 'outside' consumers, such as in the 
      publishing industry, a non-structured or proprietary description structure 
      is not sufficient as many consumers today maintain their own digital 
      archives. </P>
      <P>It is therefore necessary to not only caption digital pictures 
      adequately but to also caption them with a structure that is acceptable to 
      the widest possible audience.</P>

      <P>Whenever information technology is adopted by a market sector its 
      growth is always followed by a need for standardisation so that data can 
      be easily interchanged between differing systems. The Internet for example 
      has only been able to embrace a phenomenal rate of growth because data is 
      interchanged using a platform-independent standard known as 'HTML'. In 
      medicine digitised X-rays and other medical images can be interchanged 
      across platforms because they are captioned with a format known as 
      'DICOM'. </P>
      <P>In the publishing industry however things are not so well defined. 
      Perhaps this is because publishing is such a diverse activity that no one 
      standard will cover all needs. For digital still pictures however there 
      are two possible standards - one ratified jointly by the International 
      Press Telecommunications Council and the Newspaper Association of America 
      (IPTC -NAA); and a sub-set of the IPTC standard that has become itself a 
      de facto standard because of the widespread use of Adobe's PhotoShop. </P>

      <P>This standard was developed by a consortium of world-wide 'content' 
      providers such as Reuters and AP whos services deliver a range of 
      products including news, financial data, graphics, still pictures, movie 
      and audio clips, over a range of transport mechanisms such as satellite, 
      wide area networks, cable and direct links. The standard is therefore 
      constructed in two parts - the first dealing with the routing and delivery 
      of the content, and the second dealing with how the content is described. 
      </P>
      <P>In IPTC terms, what gets delivered is known, not as a picture, text 
      file, audio clip or anything else that specific. It is known simply as an 
      'Object', and the addressing information needed in order to route and 
      deliver the object is known as that object's 'envelope'. </P>
      <P><STRONG>Part One</STRONG> of the IPTC standard - the format of the 
      envelope, is really only of interest to the likes of Reuters and end users 
      such as national newspapers, broadcasters and financial institutions as it 
      aides in the automatic delivery of items to the right 'desk'. It has a 
      lesser relevance in the context of captioning digital pictures for Photo 
      libraries. </P>
      <P>It is to <STRONG>Part Two </STRONG>of the standard that many picture 
      suppliers turn in order to structure their captions. This is by no means 
      universal but since, as we shall see later, PhotoShop uses a subset of 
      part two, it's about the nearest thing available to common practice. </P>
      <P><STRONG>Table 1</STRONG> below lists the complete IPTC standard fields. 
      Although this might look complicated, remember that all we are trying to 
      do here is to bring some standardisation to how we structure the fields of 
      a database. Columns one and two represent the field names - the numbers 
      are used by the database and the names used for the field headings. Column 
      three gives a brief description of how the field should be used - ie what 
      sort of content the field should hold. The fourth column defines what type 
      of data the field should contain - text, dates etc. Notice that many 
      fields do not contain 'words' but codes which represent entries in 
      standardised lists. For example, the Category field is not a text string 
      but three Alpha characters.</P>

      <P>Given the almost universal use of PhotoShop by picture consumers it 
      makes sense to consider its captioning structure when constructing 
      databases for use in phot libraries. </P>
      <P><BIG><STRONG>Which fields to use?</STRONG></BIG></P>
      <P>As a sub-set of the full standard the PhotoShop fields are a good place 
      to start but there are some significant drawbacks and limitations for 
      photo libraries. </P>
      <P>Firstly the scope of the headings is often insufficient. Libraries 
      often need to record additional information such as 'Restrictions' whereby 
      images may have limitations imposed upon their sale due to copyright, 
      content, exclusivity or other commercial reasons. Although the 'Special 
      Instructions' field might seem appropriate for this use oftentimes 
      additional fields are required.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>Secondly, the type and length of data that can be entered into each 
      field can lead to problems - the 'Caption' fields for example can only 
      take up to 255 characters; and whilst we might want to use some text in 
      the 'Category' field we can't because this field will only accept a 
      three-character code. </P>
      <P>And finally the IPTC standard has moved on since PhotoShop incorporated 
      this scheme and the standard now officially discourages the use of the 
      "Category' and "Sub-Category' fields. Rather than continuing to let 
      picture suppliers define their own categories and sub-categories, the 
      standard now attempts to predefine what these categorisations should be. 
      It's debatable whether or not this is an improvement but the fact remains 
      that the standard and PhotoShop are now in conflict.</P>
      <P><BIG><STRONG>Storing the caption information.</STRONG></BIG></P>
      <P>There are three principal places to store a picture's caption 
      information; as a separate text file, as part of the JPEG data stream or 
      for Macintosh files as one or more 'resources'. </P>
      <P>Saving the caption as a separate text file is the most flexible method 
      as it imposes no particular limitations on the textual data and text files 
      can be read on all computer platforms. Its drawback though is that two 
      files must be delivered and managed for each picture. </P>
      <P>Saving the caption as part of the JPEG data stream avoids having two 
      files and is potentially suitable for both Macintosh and PCs. But the 
      problem is where precisely in the data stream to store the information? 
      PhotoShop stores its caption at the start of the stream, other products 
      and the end of the data stream - and just about any other place can be 
      encountered. Whilst PhotoShop is widespread and itself can import picture 
      files from a number of other applications, it is not always certain that 
      the caption data will be in a place that PhotoShop can understand. </P>
      <P>Saving the caption as a resource is common practice but only in as much 
      as image manipulation has until recently been done mostly on Macintosh 
      computers. But what do we mean by a 'resource'. Unlike files generated on 
      PC's, Macintosh files are actually made up of two parts - even though to 
      the outside world they look like single files. These two parts are known 
      in programming terms as 'forks' - one for the data and one for the file's 
      'resources'. </P>
      <P>Resources may at first seem to be a rather abstract concept due to 
      their invisibility at the operating system level. But consider for a 
      moment a file that is an application or programme. Programmes need to put 
      up dialogue boxes and messages. They need to open windows and have buttons 
      etc. It is convenient to gather all these functions together in the 
      resource fork as it makes it easier to both maintain and edit them - 
      translating all the English into another language for example. For data 
      files the situation is far less complicated but non the less useful. </P>
      <P>File resource forks can contain such things as custom icons, file 
      version information and in our case, the caption for the picture data. If 
      a file is opened with an application that is capable of displaying the 
      resource fork, various resources would be observed, each with a name and a 
      number. The icons that you see on your Mac for example vary according to 
      the view that you have selected - list, small icons or large icons. These 
      mini pictures are stored in a file's icon resource which would have a 
      number something like -16455. </P>
      <P>We might expect therefore that our caption will be contained in some 
      sort of a caption resource. This is true - and it's not. Unfortunately, 
      although PhotoShop stores its caption information mostly in a resource 
      known as the ANPA (IPTC) resource, not all of it is stored there and 
      furthermore other applications may store their captions in entirely 
      different resources altogether. </P>
      <P><BIG><STRONG>Why the Category field is a problem.</STRONG></BIG></P>
      <P>The current IPTC standard defines categories (ie picture categories) in 
      such a way that it is up to the service providers to come up with schemes 
      of their own. What the standard originally provided was a three character 
      code followed by a 64 character description field plus one other 64 
      character field intended to refine these categories - the Supplemental 
      Category field.&nbsp; Thus a provider would design its own scheme along 
      the lines of say ..</P>
      <P>AAA = Sport<BR>AAB = Politics<BR>AAC = Personalities etc.<BR><BR>And 
      whatever they liked in the supplemental category field. It doesn't take 
      much to see that this soon degenerates into a pretty non-standard standard 
      with each picture supplier categorising their content differently.&nbsp; 
      Revision 4 of the standard provides for an alternative way to standardise 
      categories and sub categories whereby the IPTC now defines what these 
      should be and calls the field the Subject Reference field. And furthermore 
      it advises on the use of the Category and Sub Category fields as follows 
      .. </P>
      <P>"Use of these fields is deprecated. It is likely that these fields will 
      not be included in further versions of the standard". </P>
      <P>Note: PhotoShop still uses this scheme! </P>
      <P>Subject Reference fields </P>
      <P>A typical Subject Reference field would like like ..</P>
      <P>IPTC : 10170100 : Arts, Culture &amp; Entertainment : Theatre : 
      Actors</P>
      <P>Notice that there are five parts to this field each separated by a 
      colon. The first two parts are mandatory and the remaining three are 
      optional. </P>
      <P>Subject Reference Part 1 - IPR</P>
      <P>This part provides a mandatory 'Information Provider Reference'. Unless 
      Camera Press becomes a registered provider with the IPTC, along with the 
      likes of Agence</P>
      <P>France Presse - 'AFP', Associated Press - 'AP', or Reuters - 'Reuters', 
      this field should contain 'IPTC'. </P>
      <P>Subject Reference Part 2 - SRN</P>
      <P>The Subject Reference number is an 8 digit number which completely 
      takes over from the 'Category' and 'Sub-Category' fields. However, not any 
      old number will do here. The IPTC maintains a list of approved numbers 
      which relate to specific subjects and hence to use an approved number this 
      list needs to be consulted each time a picture is captioned - and it's a 
      long list! Furthermore, unless you as a picture supplier become a 
      registered provider with the IPTC you has no say in what the list of 
      subject matter contains - you must use those already defined. </P>
      <P>The Subject Reference Number is itself built up from three parts. </P>
      <P>The first two digits come form a list of subject numbers which match 
      broad categories of subject matter. eg <BR>10 = Arts, Culture &amp; 
      Entertainment</P>
      <P>The next three digits are taken from a table which further classifies 
      the preceding section<BR>eg 170 = Theatre</P>
      <P>The last three digits are taken from a table which provides more detail 
      to the preceding section<BR>eg 100 = Actors</P>
      <P>(this is actually a fictitious example as the table of classifications 
      was not available) And so our Subject Reference number would look as 
      follows ... </P>
      <P>Subject Reference Field Example<BR>IPR (Information Provider 
      Reference)<BR>SRN<BR>(Subject Reference Number)<BR>SN<BR>(Subject 
      Name)<BR>SMN<BR>(Subject Matter Name)<BR>SDN<BR>(Subject Detail 
      Name)<BR>IPTC<BR>:<BR>10170100<BR>:<BR>Arts, Culture &amp; 
      Entertainment<BR>:Theatre<BR>:Actors</P>
      <P>Now, it would be perfectly legitimate when captioning a picture to 
      enter in the Subject Reference field nothing more than .. 
      <BR><BR>IPTC:10170100</P>
      <P>The computers of customers with automated picture reception facilities 
      would be able to understand the subject matter and detail of this picture 
      exactly. But those less fortunate customers would have no idea what the 
      heck '10170100' meant. For this reason the Subject Reference field can 
      have three optional parameters - each separated by a colon, which provide 
      textual interpretations of the Subject Reference Number. </P>
      <P>Subject Reference Part 3 - Subject Name</P>
      <P>Up to 64 characters eg 'Arts, Culture &amp; Entertainment' </P>
      <P>Subject Reference Part 4 - Subject Matter Name</P>
      <P>Up to 64 characters eg 'Theatre' </P>
      <P>Subject Reference Part 5 - Subject Detail Name </P>
      <P>Up to 64 characters eg 'Actors'</P>
      <P>Hence we get our full entry which both computers and people can 
      understand ... <BR><STRONG>IPTC : 10170100 : Arts, Culture &amp; 
      Entertainment : Theatre : Actors</STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG><BIG>In conclusion</BIG></STRONG></P>
      <P>It might seem from the above that there is little about the IPTC 
      standard that is in fact standard and to some extent this is true. But 
      many end-user's systems such as those used in the newspaper and magazine 
      markets expect to receive digital pictures captioned under the IPTC 
      format. What can be concluded from the above is that in order to implement 
      the standard, picture libraries need to compromise. On the one hand 
      sufficient captioning information needs to be provided so that images can 
      be readily identified and catalogued. On the other hand too much 
      information slows down the time it takes to ready pictures for delivery. 
      At Camera Press in London England, for example, the scope of the PhotoShop 
      fields available has proven to be insufficient for internal use and extra 
      fields - both IPTC and fields specific to Camera Press have had to be 
      used. Internally all images are catalogued in a Phraséa database which 
      creates a separate text file for the caption but Phraséa is also able to 
      read PhotoShop's internal caption during the archiving process. Those who 
      access the Phraséa database directly to download pictures can get the best 
      of both worlds, the full text file and the picture file's internal caption 
      which can be read by PhotoShop. Accessing pictures via the world wide web 
      however only delivers the file's internal caption. </P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that many end-users underestimate the significance of 
      captioning structures - after all it's the digital image that they are 
      interested in. But designing suitable captioning structures, as we have 
      seen above, is a tricky business. Get it wrong at the outset and it 
      becomes increasingly difficult to correct your mistakes as your archive 
      grows. Reworking thousands of captions is not something that you want to 
      do too often! </P>
      <P>If you are about to design a caption structure it is important to bear 
      in mind the following ... </P>
      <P>1. The overwhelming majority of your customers will download the 
      picture file ONLY - and many will not even bother to read the text within 
      PhotoShop's 'File Info' window. eg, special prices! </P>
      <P>2. If you define fields that are additional to those that PhotoShop can 
      understand they will most likely not be transmitted to the end user. This 
      can be either a problem or a benefit depending on your caption structure. 
      </P>
      <P>3. It is not advisable to use the 'Category' and 'Sub-Category' fields 
      as these are no longer supported by the standard. Since these fields are 
      potentially so important it is essential to understand how the new 
      'Subject Reference' field works. The full standard can be obtained from <A
