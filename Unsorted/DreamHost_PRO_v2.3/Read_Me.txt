The next step of the setup proceedure
is to copy the /dreamhost/ directory 
and all the included sub directorys
to your server.

You will then run the install.php file
from you web browser to complete the
setup proceedure.

Example: http://yourdomain.com/dreamhost/install.php

Once you have completed the setup proceedure,
you must delete the following files from the
/dreamhost/ directory on your server:

install.php
install_1.php
install_2.php
install_3.php

If you leave the files on you server, it is a 
security hole, since anybody could go run the
setup program and edit the login information.
