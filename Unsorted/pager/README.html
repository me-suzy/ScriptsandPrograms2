<ul>
<li>The form code is created automatically by the script. Just copy and paste it into one of your HTML documents.

</ul>
<br><br><br><br>



<a name=requirements><h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a href=http://php.net>PHP</a></b> (version 3 or later). Ask your web hosting company if you don't know if
they offer PHP.
</ul>

<a name=faq><h3>FAQ</h3>
<b>When I enter the URL to the script, the browser shows a white page with a lot of PHP code.</b><br>
You need to add the following lines to the .htaccess file:<p>

<i>AddType application/x-httpd-php .php<br>
AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php</i><p>
See the .htaccess question in this FAQ if you don't know how to do this.<p>

<b>How do I edit the .htaccess file?</b><br>
Well, first of all you need to establish whether there's a .htaccess file in your document root or not. This can be
done be performing the following test: Point your browser to <b>http://yoursite.com/.htaccess</b> (note the dot before "htaccess"). If you get
a 404 error (File Not Found), there's no .htaccess file in your document root. However, if you get a 403 error ("Forbidden"), there's a .htaccess in your document root.
If you don't have a .htaccess file, you will need to make one. Open a text editor, click "New" and write the necessary lines (the lines are shown elsewhere in this FAQ). You should not write anything else besides these lines -- no HTML tags, no PHP tags, etc.
When you're done writing the file, upload it to the server and place it in the document root. Perform the test above to make sure the file has been placed in the right location.
If there's already a .htaccess file in your document root, all you need to do is load this file into a text editor and add the appropiate lines at the bottom of the file (the lines you need to write are shown elsewhere in this FAQ).
<p>

<b>If a write a message that is longer than 450 characters, the script outputs an error message.</b><br>
ICQ pager messages cannot contain more than 450 characters. This is a limitation of ICQ, not of the Pager script.
