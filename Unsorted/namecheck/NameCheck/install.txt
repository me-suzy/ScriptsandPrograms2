PURPOSE / FUNCTIONS
 - In today's world of the web, having the name is just as important - maybe
   even moreso - as having the content. A memorable domain name
   ("www.yoursite.com") can increase the number of visitors to your site
   exponentially; as well as repeat hits from clients remembering your
   URL, a lot of people will also instinctively try addresses such as
   "download.com", "freestuff.com", "hotchicks.com"...
 - So get the name you want! If you know that a domain name is owned by
   someone who doesn't use or want it, or that is due to expire soon, simply
   run NameCheck regularly and you will be notified AS SOON AS the name is
   dropped!
 - Scorching speed; forking allows many names to be checked simultaneously.
   In tests, a list of 150 names (.com, .net, .org, .uk) were checked in 
   just 18s, on a 56k connection!
 - Returns the results you ask for - in-depth process summaries, a simple
   list of names, the domains that *are* taken; whatever you want!
 

USAGE
 - To run the script, execute the following commands:
	$ chmod +x namecheck
	$ ./namecheck -h
 - A help dialog should now be displayed. If an error message similar
   to "No such file or directory" is returned, the path to the perl binary
   is incorrect - edit the top line ("#!/usr/bin/perl") to point to the right
   location.
 - For basic usage, just use:
	 ./namecheck <domain_name_listfile>
   Add the -f flag for much faster performance. Increase the number of
   child processes spawned with "-m <n>" - increasing n above 50 is not
   recommended.
 - It is recommended that, if you wish to know if a name has been dropped,
   that the script is set up in crontab to run at least once a day. Some
   domain databases update even more frequently than once an hour!
   
   To run the script every night at midnight, add the line:
   
0 0 * * * root (cd /path/to/name/check && ./namecheck freedomains)

   to your crontab.
   
   If you'd prefer it runs more often - every 6 hrs in this example -
   and print those domains *not* taken, in short form, use:

0 0,6,12,18 * * * root (cd /path/to/name/check && ./namecheck -iq freedomains)
