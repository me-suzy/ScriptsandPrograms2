"ON WHICH EBAY OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES. BY PRESSING THE "
"&quot;I ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BELOW.\n"
"Welcome to eBay Inc.&#146;s User Agreement. This Agreement describes the terms "
"and conditions applicable to your use of our services at eBay.com. By clicking "
"the &quot;I Accept&quot; button, you accept the terms and conditions of this "
"Agreement. If you do not accept these terms and conditions or have any questions "
"that our User Agreement Frequently Asked Questions or our User Agreement Revision "
"Frequently Asked Questions cannot answer, please contact agree-questions@ebay.com. \n"
"We may amend this Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on our site. "
"If you wish to receive an email update for each amendment to this Agreement "
"please click the checkbox at the bottom of this page. The amended terms shall "
"automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on our site. "
"This Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing signed by both "
"parties. This agreement was revised on March 31, 1999.\n"
"Eligibility for Membership. Our services are available only to individuals who "
"can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the "
"foregoing, our services are not available to minors. If you do not qualify, "
"please do not use our services. eBay may refuse our services (such as, but not "
"limited to listings, chat, and bidding) to anyone at any time, in our sole discretion. "
"Fees. Joining eBay is free. Our then-current Fees and Credit Policies for "
"selling items on eBay are available at http://www.ebay.com/agreement-fees.html, "
"and are incorporated herein by reference. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are "
"quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all applicable taxes and "
"for all hardware, software, service and other costs you incur to bid, buy, "
"procure a listing from us or access our servers. We may in our sole discretion "
"add, delete or change some or all of our services at any time.\n"
"eBay is Only a Venue. Our site acts as the venue for sellers to conduct "
"auctions and for bidders to bid on sellers&#146; auctions. We are not involved "
"in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, we have no "
"control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth "
"or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability "
"of buyers to buy items. We cannot and do not control whether or not sellers will "
"complete the sale of items they offer or buyers will complete the purchase of "
"items they have bid on. In addition, note that there are risks of dealing with "
"foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretense.\n" 
"Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does "
"not confirm that each user is who they claim to be. Therefore, because you must "
"be careful in dealing with other users to avoid fraud, we have established a "
"user-initiated feedback system to help you evaluate who you are dealing with. "
"We also encourage you to communicate directly with a trading partner to help you "
"evaluate with whom you are dealing. Please practice safe trading. If you have "
"any concerns about your trading partner, please consider the use of a third "
"party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification. \n"
"Such services are available on our helpful Services page. Because we do not "
"and cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings, in the event that you have a "
"dispute with one or more users, you release eBay (and our agents and employees) "
"from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and "
"nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, "
"arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a "
"California resident, you waive California Civil Code ยง1542, which says: "
"&quot;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not "
"know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, "
"which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the "
"debtor.&quot; For legal reasons, we cannot nor do we try to control the "
"information provided by other users which is made available through our system. \n"
"By its very nature, other people&#146;s information may be offensive, harmful "
"or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. "
"We expect that you will use caution -- and common sense -- when using our site. \n"
"Bidding and Buying. As a bidder, if you have the highest bid at the end of the "
"auction, at or above the minimum bid price (or in the case of reserve auctions, "
"at or above the reserve price), and your bid is accepted by the seller, you are "
"obligated to complete the transaction. Bids are not retractable except in "
"exceptional circumstances such as the seller materially changing the description "
"of the item after your bid or clear typographical errors, or when you can not "
"authenticate the identity of the seller. You may not bid in a way that pulls "
"other bidders to their maximum bid, retract the high bid, and then rebid at a "
"small increment above the legitimate high bidder (bid manipulation). \n"
"If you choose to bid on adult items, you are certifying that you have the legal "
"right to purchase items intended for adults only. \n"
"Listing and Selling. Listings are text descriptions, graphics and pictures on "
"eBay's web site supplied by you that either; (a) textually describe the item you "
"are listing for auction, or (b) link to the text, graphics and picture(s) "
"describing the item you are listing for auction. You may post on eBay's site "
"either or both of these listing types, provided that you place such listings in "
"an appropriate category. All Dutch auction items must be identical (the size, "
"color, make, and model all must be the same for each item). At any given time "
"you may not promote identical items in more than seven listings (whether Dutch "
"or Regular auction style) on the website. \n"
"If you receive one or more bids at or above your stated minimum price "
"(or in the case of reserve auctions, at or above the reserve price), "
"then you are obligated to complete the transaction with the highest bidder, "
"unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as; (x) the buyer fails to "
"meet the terms of your listing (such as payment method), or (y) you cannot "
"authenticate the identity of the buyer. You may not email bidders in a "
"currently open auction being run by a different seller, offering similar or "
"the same items at any price level (bid siphoning), nor may you use an alias to "
"place bids on your auction for any reason. \n"
"Without limiting any other remedies, eBay may suspend or terminate your account "
"if you are found (by conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow investigation, "
"or otherwise) to have engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with our site. \n"
"eBay's Legal Buddy Program works to ensure that the items listed for auction do "
"not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other rights of those third parties. \n"
"Legal Buddy Program Members have the ability to report infringing auction items, "
"which are thereby expeditiously removed. Legal Buddy Program Members have direct "
"access to some of your personally identifiable information as described in the "
"Privacy Policy. eBay cooperates with Legal Buddy Program Members and with local, "
"state and federal law enforcement in enforcement actions. Without limiting other "
"remedies, eBay will suspend or terminate your account if you repeatedly infringe "
"third party intellectual property rights. Your Information. Your information "
"includes any information you provide to us or other users during the registration, "
" bidding or listing process, in any public message area (including the Cafรฉ or "
"the feedback area) or through any email feature (defined herein as &quot;Your "
"Information&quot;). With respect to Your Information: \n"
"6.1 You are solely responsible for Your Information, and we act as a passive "
"conduit for your online distribution and publication of Your Information. "
"However, we may take any action with respect to such information we deem "
"necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe it may create "
"liability for us or may cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of "
"our ISPs or other suppliers. \n"
"6.2 Your Information and your items for sale on eBay: (a) shall not be fraudulent "
"or involve the sale of counterfeit or stolen items; (b) shall not infringe any "
"third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary "
"rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (c) shall not violate any law, statute, "
"ordinance or regulation (including without limitation those governing export "
"control, consumer protection, unfair competition, antidiscrimination or false "
"advertising); (d) shall not be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening "
"or unlawfully harassing; (e) shall not be obscene or contain child pornography "
"or, if otherwise harmful to minors, shall be posted only in the Erotica, "
"Adults Only section and shall be distributed only to people legally permitted "
"to receive such content; (f) shall not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, "
"worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are "
"intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or "
"expropriate any system, data or personal information; and (g) shall not link "
"directly or indirectly to or include descriptions of goods or services that: "
"(i) are prohibited under this Agreement; (ii) are identical to other items "
"you have up for auction but are priced lower than your auction item's reserve "
"or minimum bid amount; (iii) are concurrently listed for auction on a web site "
"other than eBay's; or (iv) you do not have a right to link to or include. "
"Furthermore, you may not post on our site or sell through our site any: "
"(x) item that, by paying to us the listing fee or the final value fee, could "
"cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or "
"(y) item that is currently on eBay's Prohibited Items List, and incorporated "
"herein, which may be updated from time to time.\n"
"6.3 Solely to enable eBay to use Your Information you supply us with, so that "
"we are not violating any rights you might have in that information, you agree "
"to grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, "
"sublicenseable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise the copyright and "
"publicity rights (but no other rights) you have in Your Information, in any "
"media now known or not currently known, with respect to Your Information. "
"eBay will only use Your Information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\n" 
"No Price Manipulation. Sellers may not manipulate the price of their item, "
"either by using a shill (a secondary account or third party) or by bidding "
"themselves. System Integrity. You may not use any device, software or routine "
"to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the eBay site "
"or any auction being conducted on our site. You may not take any action which "
"imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure. \n"
"You may not disclose or share your password to any third parties or use your "
"password for any unauthorized purpose. Feedback. You may not take any actions "
"which may undermine the integrity of the feedback system, such as: leaving "
"positive feedback for yourself using secondary User IDs or third parties; "
"leaving negative feedback for other users using secondary accounts or third "
"parties (feedback bombing); or leaving negative feedback if a user fails to "
"perform some action that is outside the scope of the auction (feedback extortion). "
"If you earn a net feedback rating of -4 (minus four), your membership will "
"automatically suspend, and you will be unable to list or bid. \n"
"Because feedback ratings are not designed for any purpose other than for "
"facilitating trading between eBay users, we may suspend or terminate your "
"account if you choose to market or promote your eBay feedback rating in any "
"venue other than eBay. Breach. We may immediately issue a warning, temporarily "
"suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate your membership, any of your current "
"auctions, and any other information you place on the site if you breach this "
"Agreement or if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you "
"provide to us. \n"
"Privacy. Our then-current privacy policies, available at "
"http://www.ebay.com/privacy-policy.html, are incorporated herein by "
"reference. No Warranty. WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE EBAY WEBSITE AND OUR "
"SERVICES &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESS OR "
"IMPLIED. WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF "
"TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. \n"
"Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing "
"disclaimer may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights "
"and you may also have other legal rights which vary from state to state. \n"
"Limit of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR LOST "
"PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (HOWEVER ARISING, "
"INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. \n"
"OUR LIABILITY, AND THE LIABILITY OF OUR SUPPLIERS, TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES "
"IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES YOU PAY "
"TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, AND (B) "
"$100. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so the foregoing "
"limitation may not apply to you. \n"
"General Compliance with Laws. You shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes, "
"ordinances and regulations regarding your use of our service and your bidding on, "
"listing, purchase and sale of items. \n"
"No Agency. You and eBay are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, "
"joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is "
"intended or created by this Agreement. Notices. Except as explicitly stated "
"otherwise, any notices shall be given by email to agree-questions@ebay.com "
"(in the case of eBay) or to the email address you provide to eBay during the "
"registration process (in your case), or such other address as the party shall "
"specify. Notice shall be deemed given 24 hours after email is sent, unless the "
"sending party is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, "
"we may give you notice by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt "
"requested, to the address provided to eBay during the registration process. In "
"such case, notice shall be deemed given 3 days after the date of mailing. \n"
"Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this "
"Agreement shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the "
"commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such "
"controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not "
"be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other "
"party. The arbitrary shall be conducted in San Jose, California, and judgment "
"on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction "
"thereof. Either you or eBay may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a "
"court of competent jurisdiction in San Jose, California necessary to protect "
"the rights or property of you or eBay pending the completion of arbitration. \n"
"General. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the "
"State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to "
"be performed entirely within California between California residents. We do not "
"guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to our services, and "
"operation of our site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of "
"our control. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or "
"unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall "
"be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, "
"limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to "
"act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act "
"with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. This Agreement sets forth the "
"entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter "
"hereof. Disclosures. The services hereunder are offered by eBay, Inc., located "
"at 2005 Hamilton Ave., Suite 350, San Jose, CA 95125. If you are a California "

											"Because feedback ratings are not designed for any purpose other than for "
											"facilitating trading between eBay users, we may suspend or terminate your "
											"account if you choose to market or promote your eBay feedback rating in any "
											"venue other than eBay. Breach. We may immediately issue a warning, temporarily "
