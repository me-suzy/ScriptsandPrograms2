DATA WAREHOUSE PLAN
-------------------

We will create a table for each of the tables listed below on python, then
export those new tables, and import to algebra. Indexes will then be created
on algebra. Note: the column MARKETPLACE has been excluded from all tables
which contain it since the value so far is always zero.

A one-time copy of the tables (all rows) will need to be done initially,
after that we can append new rows based on date. (I'm not sure if this will
work for ebay_items_arc.)

Table Naming Convention:

Table naming convention will be the original name with '_move' appended. This
will be the in-transit table name. Once on algebra, we will insert rows from
the in-transit table to the actual table. That way the names will be the same
on python and algebra. This will allow existing reports which were run on
python to be run on algebra with no changes.

Exceptions to the naming convention are:
 - The ebay_users and ebay_user_info tables which are combined into one table:
   ebay_combined_users_move. This table will be named: ebay_combined_users on
   algebra.
 - ebay_historical_data: This will be a one-time export and import to algebra.
 - ebay_reg_dates: This will be a one-time export and import to algebra.
