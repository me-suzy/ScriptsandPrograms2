    alt="Pierre Omidyar"><p>Pierre brings to eBay a history of success with some of the most
    visionary companies in Silicon Valley, and has established a personal reputation among the
    who's-who of the Valley.</p>
    <p>A co-founder of Ink Development Corp. in 1991, Pierre was instrumental in leading the
    firm into the uncharted waters of Internet shopping in 1993. The company, then renamed

    <p>In 1995, Pierre accurately foresaw a demand for consumer trading over the Internet and
    developed the eBay service as an experiment to assess demand for this type of trade. With
    consumer usage having exceeded all expectations, Pierre resigned from his full-time
    position in Developer Relations for General Magic to further develop the eBay service.
    While at General Magic, Pierre developed the first Web application for Magic Cap, and
    contributed to other significant Internet projects.</p>
    <p>Prior to co-founding Ink, Pierre was a successful developer for Claris, a subsidiary of
    Apple Computer, and for other Macintosh-oriented software development companies.</p>
    <p>Pierre is a graduate of Tufts University (BS, Computer Science, 1988).</p>
