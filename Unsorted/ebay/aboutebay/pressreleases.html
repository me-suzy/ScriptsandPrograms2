eBay (<a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>), the world's personal trading community, today announced the debut of its new fan-based, online Elvis destination site, "All the King's Things."  The site, inspired by a book authored by eBay employee and Elvis expert Robin Rosaaen, provides a place for fans of "The King" to buy and/or sell "all things Elvis" from their personal collections of memorabilia.  Located at <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/elvis/">www.ebay.com/elvis</A>, the site will also provide entertaining and educational features such as an Elvis Museum, an Elvis chat room, Elvis Collector of the Week highlights, and articles from magazine partners as well as Elvis fans and friends.
<P>
"With more than 50,000 Elvis fans coming together offline for the Elvis Week 1998 festivities in Memphis this week, we couldn't think of a more appropriate time to add another level of excitement for the eBay Elvis fan community," said Steve Westly, eBay vice president, marketing and business development.  "This way Elvis fans anywhere in the world can celebrate their love for the King."
<P>
At this time, eBay has more than 150 new Elvis items for auction every day, ranging from mint-condition trading cards and personal belongings to records and autographed photographs.  "It was this enthusiasm for the King in the eBay community that drove our choice for a destination Web page on our site," added Westly.
<P>
According to Elvis expert Rosaaen, "Elvis' one-of-kind charisma and magnetism make him dear to many people, and now for the first time Elvis fans from all over the world can interact 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to really celebrate Elvis and the countless items he inspired."  Rosaaen, who was called Rockin' Robin by the King himself, is known for having one of the largest Elvis collections in the country and has appeared as an Elvis expert on Geraldo and Oprah Winfrey as well as other national news and talk shows.  
<P>
The Elvis Museum on eBay showcases highlights from Rosaaen's personal collection of more than 40,000 Elvis items, which she has developed during the last 30 years.  Her vast collection includes a blue suede jacket worn by Elvis on several occasions (appraised at $7,000), a lock of his hair (one recently sold for $5,000) and an assortment of concert and security artifacts from 1969 - 1977 (articles valued at $50 - $1,000).  Rosaaen will be available to answer questions from the eBay community through the "Ask the Expert" site feature and her participation in the Elvis chat room.  All inquiries from Elvis fans can be sent to elvis@ebay.com.

What do Valentino(tm), Inky(tm), Peanuts(tm) and Lefty(tm) all have in common?

San Jose, Calif.- May 18, 1998
<P>
eBay, the World's Personal Trading Community(tm) (<a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>), today introduced a new user ID feature which shields email addresses of its members, protecting them from unsolicited email, or "spam." Now, email addresses of traders are available only to other eBay users through password-protected requests. These aliases eliminate the ability of other companies or unregistered individuals to obtain eBay members' addresses and to send unsolicited email.  
<P>
eBay was founded with the premise that the company operated within an open and honest marketplace where users did not need to disguise their email addresses. However, in recent months, registered eBay users have been spammed by competitive online auction companies. By collecting eBay members' email addresses through an automatic software program, or a "robot," these companies are not only violating eBay rules by invading member privacy, but are also threatening to disrupt service for legitimate users.
<P>
"Spamming is an inappropriate business practice, and it is unfortunate that it has become necessary to protect our members from junk email sent by other companies," said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of eBay. "However, we believe that we have created a solution which protects email addresses from spam, while at the same time, upholds the established community values that our legitimate users respect and reinforce themselves."
<P>
To address the growing need to protect its members from these invasions, eBay has developed a user ID option, where eBay members can select a unique nickname, or alias, which differs from their email addresses. The alias makes it difficult for "robots" to harvest email addresses, while protecting communication between members of the eBay community. To access a fellow trader's email address, a registered user simply clicks on that person's user ID and enters his or her own eBay information. eBay will reveal that person's email address, allowing legitimate users to communicate quickly and effectively and to consummate trades in a way that does not expose them to unwanted spam. 
<P>
"The legal battle over companies' right to spam consumers as a form of mass-marketing is heating up," added Whitman. "eBay takes this debate seriously and is addressing the issue now, before any legislation is passed, to preserve the privacy of its users. By offering precautionary measures such as user IDs to protect users from spam, eBay continues to maintain a safe and secure place to shop online." 
<P>
"eBay is the only online auction site that I choose to do business with," said Jeffrey Warantz, a registered eBay user. "When I receive spam promoting other auctions, I know that the senders found my address on eBay's site. This new feature should help eliminate the unwanted intrusion of receiving spam from other companies."

    <p><font size="2">San Jose, Calif. May 4, 1998</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">eBay, the world's leading personal trading community (<a

    href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>), today announced that eBay ranks as the
    number one commerce site in time spent by Internet users. According to the latest Media
    Metrix report, eBay ranks third in the overall number of minutes spent on an Internet
    site, just behind Yahoo! and AOL.com. For the past three months, eBay has consistently
    been one of the top ten most visited shopping sites. The news comes as eBay celebrates its
    10 millionth auction since its inception in 1995. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;We attribute eBay's remarkable growth to the commitment of our
    users,&quot; said eBay's Chairman and Founder Pierre Omidyar. &quot;No other auction site
    provides the same level of service. We expect that the number of eBay users and
    transaction volume will continue to grow as consumers discover that eBay is the most
    complete and comprehensive place to trade on the Internet, as well as a great place to
    have fun and meet people with similar interests.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;The number of Internet users visiting eBay has increased
    significantly during the past year,&quot; said Douglas McFarland, Media Metrix senior vice
    president and general manager. &quot;eBay has consistently been one of the most trafficked
    shopping sites on the Web, along with power houses such as Amazon.com.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">eBay currently hosts, on average, 375,000 auctions daily. With 750,000

    <p><font size="2"><strong>James Finnegan: Sports Collector and Seller</strong><br>
    As one of eBay's most active sellers, James Finnegan of Sunrise, Florida, recently
    auctioned an autographed Reggie Jackson baseball. Other sports collectibles Finnegan has
    sold include a Willie Stargell autographed baseball and autographed pictures of a young
    Mickey Mantle.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Just three years ago, Finnegan was selling sports collectibles and
    memorabilia in his retail store and at trade shows. Since business was not going well,
    James decided to sell online, and discovered eBay by surfing the Internet.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;I was trying to sell an autographed Michael Jordan jersey, but I
    couldn't sell it in my store,&quot; said Finnegan. &quot;I put it up on eBay, where it
    quickly sold for $300. After that experience, I decided to close down my store and
    transition my business entirely to eBay.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">James conducts all of his business online and credits eBay for his
    tremendous success.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>Myk Pleet: Avid Sports Collector</strong><br>
    While looking around on eBay, Myk Pleet found a sports item that caught his eye--an
    autographed Reggie Jackson baseball. He purchased the ball for $31. According to Pleet, a
    similar item would have cost him up to $100 in a sports shop</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;I was a big Reggie Jackson fan when I was younger,&quot; said
    Pleet, &quot;and this ball brings back fond memories.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Pleet is an avid sports collector who discovered eBay four months ago
    while visiting a friend in Arizona. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;My friend showed me some great sports stuff he'd bought on eBay
    and I was hooked,&quot; said Pleet. &quot;I now spend at least an hour a day looking for
    sports collectibles on eBay.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Pleet used to be have his own sports card business, but now he buys and
    sells as a hobby. He says that eBay is the best site for sports collectors who want to buy
    and sell.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;I recommend eBay to sports collectors because it has a large
    selection and is very safe to use,&quot; said Pleet. &quot;Their feedback system helps
    keep fraud to a minimum. I wouldn't go anywhere else.&quot; </font></p>

    <p><font size="2">eBay, the leading person-to-person online auction site (<a

    category-specific home pages to its extensive list of trading and collectibles features.
    The new pages, which include computers, toys, dolls, jewelry, pottery, trading cards,
    coins and stamps, are designed to make it even more convenient and fun for users to locate
    a wide selection of their favorite collectibles.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Each new page is divided into subcategories, and also includes featured
    and &quot;hot stuff&quot; items. For example, the trading card-specific page allows sports
    fans to easily see which collectibles are available from their favorite game such as
    basketball, baseball, football or hockey. Additionally, these new pages allow eBay
    collectors to determine which new items have been added each day within a particular
    category. For a collector looking for that hot, first-edition Babe Ruth card signed by the
    king of baseball himself, this feature provides a simple way to keep tabs on the latest
    rare baseball cards up for sale.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;With varied interests and hobbies, eBay users represent a
    cross-section of America, and we strive to create a trading environment in which people
    with shared interests can connect,&quot; said Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder and CEO.
    &quot;By introducing category-specific home pages, we are providing customized access to
    the unbeatable selection of items for sale in each of our most popular categories.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The new pages also offer discussion boards in which users can post
    questions about items and meet others interested in specific categories. These users can
    exchange information that might be considered too &quot;specialized&quot; to address in
    the eBay caf?, a general discussion forum popular with the eBay community. Each
    category-specific page is accessible from multiple locations, making it convenient for new
    and existing users to take advantage of eBay's diverse selection of collectibles. Users
    can locate these pages directly from eBay's home page, via search engines such as Alta
    Vista and online directories such as Yahoo, as well as through Web sites of eBay partners.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Bryan Sweigart, an antiques dealer in Lancaster County, Pa, believes
    that his antique pottery and porcelain often sells for a higher price on eBay than it
    would at retail, because collectors from around the world are looking at the auction site
    as a key resource. &quot;Through eBay, I have extended my reach to a global community of
    collectors, and the new pottery and porcelain-specific pages should help generate even
    more traffic to my auctions.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;eBay fuels my passion for jewelry collecting,&quot; said Janette
    Contois, an eBay user from Mountain View, Calif. &quot;The jewelry-focused page is
    exciting because I can easily monitor which different items are available-vintage pieces,
    for example. This new feature makes eBay even more fun, because it organizes exactly what
    kinds of jewelry are for sale!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;As more and more people become comfortable shopping on the
    Internet, it is important for e-commerce sites, such as eBay, to provide customized
    shopping experiences that appeal to a wide range of individuals,&quot; said Nicole

Almost entirely fraud-free (99.99 percent), eBay is an entertaining and safe forum for trade and information sharing among collectors. A central feature of eBay's site is the continuous information sharing among users through chat rooms and the eBay Feedback Forum. These features build trust, provide a self-monitoring trading environment and strengthen the online community. Comments from the Feedback Forum allow users to develop "online reputations," holding traders accountable to the other members of the eBay community. eBay also hosts the eBay Caf*, where users exchange information about common interests and advice about buying and selling online.

                eBay Named "Most Visited Online Auction Site" By Media Metrix 
        </FONT>
<BR>
        <FONT SIZE="2">
                Completing more than seven million auctions makes popular person-to-person trading site one of five most visited shopping sites on the Internet

San Jose, Calif. - March 3, 1998
<P>
eBay(tm), the leading person-to-person online auction site (<a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>), announced today that the site was visited by more people in January than any other online auction site, according to Media Metrix*, the leading Web audiences measurement company. Additionally, eBay has become one of the top five most visited shopping sites on the entire Internet-the only online auction site to make the top five. eBay also announced that it has exceeded 28 million online auction bids and completed more than 7 million auctions since the company's inception in 1995. 
<P>
Media Metrix's January 1998 audiences rating report, based on at-home usage of the World Wide Web, shows that eBay is one of the top five most visited shopping sites, with nearly 1,000,000 unique visitors each month. The report also indicates that the average eBay shopper spends more than 23 minutes per usage day on the site. This figure ranks first among the more than 50 sites listed within the shopping category in the report.
<P>
"The number of Internet users visiting eBay has increased rapidly during the past 12 months," said Douglas McFarland, Media Metrix senior vice president and general manager. "In January, eBay usage soared, making the site one the five most popular shopping sites on the entire Web, along with online shopping powerhouses such as Amazon.com."
<P>
eBay Growth Spurred by Strong Sense of Community & Wide Selection of Auctions
<P>
"More than 275,000 auctions are conducted each day now on eBay, and our unprecedented growth has made us the number one auction site on the Web," said Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder and CEO. "Hundreds of thousands of people have chosen eBay over other online auction sites because we offer the most diverse selection of merchandise, the safest and most reliable place to trade, and the strongest sense of friendship and community among users."
<P>
Bruce Nicklin, of Riverside, Calif, began selling used computer parts on the Internet almost two years ago. After discovering eBay, he was able to retire from his job in sales
and marketing at one of Maytag's corporations, and estimates that he has sold at least three million dollars of merchandise through the online auction site in less than two years.
<P>
"The sense of trust and community that eBay users share  is a major reason I've been so successful in growing my business on the Web," said Nicklin. "eBay has truly changed my life, both from a financial standpoint, as well as by allowing me to meet wonderful people from around the country and the world."
<P>
Janette Contois, a jewelry collector in Mountain View, Calif., discovered eBay three months ago and is impressed with the quality and prices of the treasures she has found and purchased through eBay.
<P>
"The selection of jewelry listed on the site is incredible, and I love the thrill of bidding on and winning an auction," said Contois. "I've gotten to know and trust many of the people I buy from, and have had only positive experiences on eBay."
<P>
"Online auctions such as eBay are one of the fastest-growing shopping categories on the Web," said Nicole Vanderbilt, group director for digital commerce at Jupiter Communications. "The success of an online shopping site stems from its ability to provide a secure and easy-to-use environment from which buyers and sellers can conduct business and share a strong sense of community."
