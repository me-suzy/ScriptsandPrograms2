    <td width="400" valign="top"><strong><font color="#9900FF">Judy Williams</font></strong><p>While
    stories abound of newbies who were suddenly empowered by the Web, Judy William's
    experience with eBay has provided some particularly positive and uplifting moments,
    allowing her to transition off welfare and increasingly on to self-sufficiency.</p>
    <p>Born and reared in Massachusetts, Judy had every reason to believe she would be
    successful. She was schooled in nursing and certified as a registered nurse. After moving
    to Atlanta, Texas, however, she contracted lyme disease. The disease left Judy tired and
    forgetful. She was unsuited for nursing.</p>
    <p>By the late 1980s, Judy was divorced, single mother struggling to raise her daughter
    alone. Unable to hold down a full-time job, she dabbled in tanning, buck-skinning and
    weaving - and traveled across the United States, trying to sell her goods at regional art
    shows.</p>
    <p>In 1995, Judy acquired an antique shop. But selling antiques at the shop wasn't
    lucrative. By April 1997, Judy was a divorced, single mother on welfare - doing her best
    to keep her antique shop alive. When the welfare office advised Judy to go on disability,
    Judy said &quot;I know there's something I can do.&quot;</p>
    <p>A friend had told her about eBay.</p>
    <p>Armed with a credit card, Judy bought a computer and got online. Soon, she was selling
    items on eBay and earning a living. She called the welfare office to tell them that she
    didn't need food stamps anymore. She is considering closing the antique shop.</p>
    <p>&quot;I turned down the disability,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I wanted to make it.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#9900FF">Jim Watson</font></strong></p>
    <p>Jim Watson, retiree in Fort Myers, FL, has found in eBay a new outlet to trade
    collectibles and a new social network to enrich his life. He was searching for places to
    buy components to repair and upgrade his computer system when he came across eBay in
    November 1996 while surfing the Web. Upon discovering eBay's town bazaar atmosphere, his
    interest in eBay quickly shifted to one focused around his hobby of buying and selling
    collectibles. He took advantage of the access to the large pool of knowledgeable buyers.</p>
    <p>Jim's connection to eBay further evolved when he discovered a new network of similarly
    gregarious collectors at the eBay Cafe, the site's gathering place. He regularly interacts
    with other traders there, swapping stories and learning new information about common
    interests. He has made new cyber-friends from around the world through eBay, people he
    would not have met if he hadn't gone online to shop for his computer parts. He visits many
    of these friends when they travel on vacation.</p>
    <p>Time and again, there are events that reaffirm Jim's belief that eBay is a supportive
    and safe place to trade and make friends. In one instance, a woman in Berwyn, IL., was
    presented with a computer assembled from surplus parts donated by computer buffs on eBay
    so she could continue her interactions with traders on weeknights and weekends. A man in
    Canada found a book that Jim had long wanted and sent it as a gift; Jim sent a thank you
    with a special selection from his stamp collection. Jim also answered a request for help
    from a St. Louis man to set up a stamp club; Jim now serves as an advisor to the club.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#9900FF">Chris Campagna</font></strong></p>
    <p>Christine Campagna of Berwyn, IL, is on the road to self-improvement as a result of
    discovering eBay. She found eBay in the way many users found eBay - by accident. She was
    surfing the web in February 1996 and stumbled onto a list of online auctions.</p>
    <p>Chris initially used eBay to buy and sell items, but later discovered the chat site.
    She developed relationships with other users, users who would later teach her hypertext
    markup language (HTML), the Web page design code.</p>
    <p>Because Chris did not have a computer at home, her new cyber-friends missed her during
    weeknights and weekends when she couldn't go online. In an amazing show of outreach and
    support, more than 15 users secretly sent spare computer parts to another Illinois
    resident who assembled the parts together with her husband to form a functioning computer.
    Another user donated a printer. Since receiving the computer in May 1997, Chris has
    learned how to use spreadsheet, presentation and account software with the help of eBay
    users.</td>
