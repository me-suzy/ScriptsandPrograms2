    </font>Helping People Trade</strong><p><strong><font color="#0000CC">The History</font></strong>
    &nbsp; <strong>eBay</strong> was launched by Pierre Omidyar as an experiment in electronic
    commerce. An early Internet enthusiast, Mr. Omidyar knew that people needed a central
    location to buy and sell unique items and to meet other users with similar interests. He
    started <strong>eBay</strong> to fulfill this need.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#0000CC">The Trust</font></strong>&nbsp; The key to <strong>eBay</strong>'s
    success is trust. Trust between the buyers and sellers who make up the <strong>eBay</strong>
    community. And trust between the user and <strong>eBay</strong> the company. </p>
    <p><strong><font color="#0000CC">The Feedback Forum</font></strong>&nbsp; <strong>eBay</strong>
    encourages active communication between buyers and sellers, who freely exchange
    information.</p>
    <p>To dispel hesitancy sometimes associated with Internet commerce, <strong>eBay</strong>
    invented the industry's first electronic information exchange exclusive to one-to-one
    trading--the Feedback Forum. </p>
    <p>Through <strong>eBay</strong>'s innovative Feedback Forum, users can submit comments
    about their dealings with one another. These comments, both positive and negative, form
    online reputations that follow the user throughout the site. In this way, buyers and
    sellers quickly become familiar with one another - developing relationships, building
    trust and promoting an open and honest marketplace. </p>
    <p><strong><font color="#0000CC">The Community</font></strong>&nbsp; <strong>eBay</strong>
    is the home of a unique online community. Through the bulletin boards, users meet and get
    to know each other, discuss topics of mutual interest and petition one another for
    information. These bulletin boards are public forums that encourage open communication
    between users.</p>
    <p>The community is also self-policing, and users frequently form &quot;neighborhood
    watch&quot; groups to help guard against misuse or violations of site etiquette.</p>
    <p><strong>eBay</strong> also encourages open and honest communication between the
    community and the company. Frequently, members of the community organize grassroots
    movements to improve the environment in which they work and play. </p>
    <p>Earlier this year, the community decided that the &quot;Bulletin Board&quot; did not
    adequately describe the area of the site where they congregate. The community petitioned
    the company to rename the Bulletin Board to the &quot;eBay Caf√©.&quot; And in the spirit
    of democracy, <strong>eBay</strong> responded to the consensus.</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#0000CC">Charity</font>&nbsp; eBay</strong> Foundation is administered by Community Foundation Silicon Valley. 
Community Foundation Silicon Valley (CFSV) is a tax-exempt public charity 
whose mission is to promote philanthropy and build a strong community. CFSV 
helps donors make effective charitable gifts, and makes grants to a wide 
range of nonprofit organizations.</p></td>
