There are two ways to search for information:
<ul>
<li>Use this search page to search all catalogs on this site.
<p><li>If Microsoft Knowledge Manager is installed, use the 
Microsoft Knowledge Manager Search Center.
With Knowledge Manager, you can view or create briefs on topics of 
importance to you, and receive updates by e-mail or in the Briefing channel.
Contact your system administrator to find out more about 
Microsoft Knowledge Manager.
</ul>
<p>
To use this search page, you can look for a single word.  
Or, use the tips below to refine your search to find more specific results. 
<ul>
<li>
Look for a phrase.
<br>
Example -  type <b>sports events</b> to find the exact phrase <i>sports events</i>. Since the search is not case-sensitive, this is equivalent to <i>Sports Events</i>.
<p><li>
Look for two or more words at once by using the AND operator.
<br>
Example -  type <b>sports AND events</b> to find documents that have both the word <i>sports</i> and the word <i>events</i> anywhere. 
<p><li>
Look for words that are close to each other by using the NEAR operator instead of the AND operator. 
When you use NEAR, the closer together the words are, the higher the rank of the page, so the higher it appears in the list of search results.
<br>
Example - type <b>sports NEAR events</b> to match documents where the word <i>sports</i> is within 50 words of the word <i>events</i>.
<p><li>
Look for synonyms or similar words by using the OR operator. Note that if you don't use the OR operator and search using multiple words, the words are treated as a phrase.
<br>
Example - type <b>dogs OR puppies</b> to find the word <i>dogs</i> or the word <i>puppies</i>, but not necessarily both.
<p><li>
Limit your search by using the AND NOT operator to exclude words.
<br>
Example - type <b>surfing AND NOT the Internet</b> to find all instances of <i>surfing</i>, as long as <i>surfing</i> is not followed by the phrase <i>the Internet</i>.
<p><li>
Use double quotes if you want to use AND, OR, NOT, or NEAR literally.
<br>
Example - type <b>"houses near parks"</b> to find documents with the phrase <i>houses near parks</i>. Without the double quotes, this query would use the NEAR operator instead of the phrase.
<p><li>
Use a single asterisk (*) to look for words that begin with the same letters.
<br>
Example - type <b>key*</b> to find <i>key</i>, <i>keying</i>, <i>keyhole</i>, <i>keyboard</i>, and so on. 
<p><li>
Use a double asterisk (**) to look for all forms of a word.
<br>
Example - type <b>fly**</b> to match <i>fly</i>, <i>flew</i>, <i>flown</i>, and <i>flying</i>.
</ul>
