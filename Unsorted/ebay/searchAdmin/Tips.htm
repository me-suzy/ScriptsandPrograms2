<h1><b>Tips for Searching</b></h1>

<p><b>Quotation Marks</b> <br>
To find a title with words in an exact order, use quotation
marks. For example, by typing: &quot;brown bear&quot; you will
find title descriptions which include the exact phrase
&quot;brown bear&quot;. </p>

<p><b>And</b> <br>
To find a title with two or more words, use the term
&quot;and&quot;. For example, by typing: brown and bear you will
get title descriptions with both the words &quot;brown&quot; and
&quot;bear&quot; anywhere in the title. </p>

<p><b>Or</b> <br>
To find an item title that contains one of several words, use the
term &quot;or&quot;. For example, by typing: bear or brown you
will find item titles with either the words &quot;brown&quot; or
&quot;bear.&quot; </p>

<p><b>And Not</b> <br>
To find an item description that contains one word and excludes
another word, use the term &quot;and not.&quot; For example, by
typing: bear and not brown you will yield item titles which
include the word &quot;bear&quot; and exclude the word
&quot;brown.&quot; </p>

<h2>Sorting Your Results</h2>

<p>Use the <b>sort</b> menu to select the order in which your
results will be displayed. </p>

<p><b>Ending Date</b> <br>
Search will list your results according to the times that the auctions close </p>

<p><b>Bid Price</b> <br>
Search will list your results according to the price of the highest bid. </p>

<p><b>Search Ranking</b> <br>
Search will list your results according to how well items' titles match your search criteria. <br>
</p>

<p><I>And another tip on sort. </I>The sooner you hit the resort of your choice (ending time, # of bids etc.),
the more likely you'll catch your results while they're still cached for a quicker turn around.
</p>

<h2>Narrowing your search</h2>

<p>You'll get the fastest response when the search query returns
the fewest possible matches. For example, if you're looking for a
particular &quot;barbie&quot; item, don't just type
&quot;barbie&quot; in the query box. This will return a gazillion
matches which will have to be sorted, and this takes time. We also
have decided to not return *all* possible matches to you since it
turns the system to goo. So it won't do you a whole lot of good
anyway.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a barbie dress that was made in the
1960's, the best thing to type in would be &quot;barbie and dress
and 196*&quot;. The trick is to be specific! Lots of narrowly
defined queries will get you a lot farther faster than one huge
&quot;give me the world&quot; one. </p>
