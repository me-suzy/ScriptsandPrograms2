<!-- start #34-->
<P><A NAME="1"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a User ID?</FONT>
<BR>A User ID is a "nickname" you can use to participate on eBay.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">UNDERSTANDING WHY...</B></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="2"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Why does eBay use User IDs?</FONT>
<BR>eBay believes in an open and honest marketplace. But, as many of you
are painfully aware, "robots" are sent to eBay from time to time to collect
the e-mail addresses of our users. These e-mail addresses later received
unsolicited e-mail or "spam". Robot attacks not only expose users to spam,
but they can also seriously degrade system performance. User IDs will make
it more difficult for these robots to collect your e-mail address while
protecting your communication with your eBay friends.

<P><A NAME="3"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Why did eBay do this?</FONT>
<BR>eBay wanted to help you protect your e-mail address from these robots
and the spam sent by companies using the robots. User IDs will make it
more difficult for these robots to collect your e-mail address while protecting
your communication with your eBay friends.

<P><A NAME="4"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Why did it take so long for eBay to do
this?<B>&nbsp;</B></FONT>
<BR>eBay was launched in September 1995. For two years, we operated within
an open and honest marketplace, where users werent forced to hide their
e-mail addresses. While we did not want the actions of a few companies
to force us into unnecessarily hiding e-mail addresses, we did recognize
that our community members deserved protection and privacy.

<P>eBay has worked diligently these last few months to find a solution
which protects your e-mail address from robots and spam and which still
upholds the values of the open and honest marketplace you have created
here at eBay. We believe that User IDs will do just that.

<P><A NAME="5"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Why should I have a User ID?</FONT>
<BR>Your default User ID will be your registered e-mail address. But you
might want to consider using a User ID if you are concerned about spam.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">WHO AM I...</B></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="6"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Can I choose my own User ID?</FONT>
<BR>Yes! Your family may have named you when you were born. Your friends
may have called you names when you were in school. But this is your chance
to nickname yourself anything you want.

<P><A NAME="7"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Do I have to choose my own User ID?</FONT>
<BR>No. If you dont want to choose your User ID, eBay will use your registered
e-mail address as your User ID.

<P><A NAME="8"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Why wont eBay just invent User IDs for
everyone like other sites do?</FONT>
<BR>Before User IDs, people were already nicknaming themselves and referring
to each other by nickname. The introduction of User IDs just formalized
that which we already knew: There is a real person behind an e-mail address.

<P><A NAME="9"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What can my User ID be?</FONT>
<BR>Your User ID may be a number of things. Here are some guidelines.
</P><P><I>A User ID may contain letters (a-z), numbers (0-9) and/or symbols.</I> 
</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These symbols, among others, are not permitted:
<UL>
<LI>
You may not use the "@" symbol unless your User ID is the same as your
registered e-mail address. This is to prevent anyone else from using your
e-mail address as his/her User ID.</LI>
<LI>
You may not use the "&amp;" symbol. Skippy said so.</LI>
</UL>
<P><I>A User ID must be at least two (2) characters long.</I></P>
<P><I>A User ID is case insensitive.</I></P>
<P><I>A User ID may not contain spaces.</I></P>
<P><I>A User ID may not be obscene, profane or hateful.</I></P><P>

<BR>Think about it. Using a User ID doesnt mean that other eBay users
dont know who you are!

<P>We suggest that you apply the "Mom or Dad" Rule of Decency when choosing
a User ID.
<BR>What would Mom or Dad say if they knew you were using obscenity, profanity
or hateful language in a public place? Better yet. What would they do to
you?

<P>If you think Mom or Dad wouldnt approve, you can probably be sure that
your fellow eBay users wont be too impressed either.&nbsp; Why do you
care? If you are a seller and a potential buyer sees your User ID and it
doesnt say, "Im a trustworthy, honest person," he/she is less likely
to bid on your item. No trust, no bids. If you are a bidder and a seller
sees your User ID and it doesnt say, "Im a trustworthy, honest person,"
he/she is less likely to take your bid seriously. No trust, no sale.

<P>Think about it.

<P><A NAME="10"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What should my User ID be?</FONT>
<BR>Your default User ID will be your registered e-mail address. But you
may also use your name or a creative nickname as your User ID. Here are
a few suggestions if youre stuck.
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000080">Refer to your favorite collecting area.</FONT></LI>

<BR>If your name is Roger and you collect Rabbit figurines, you might request
a User ID such as "Roger-Rabbit."
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000080">Refer to your business or occupation</FONT>.</LI>

<BR>If you use eBay to sell pet supplies business, you might request a
User ID such as "ACME_Roadrunner_Kits or Roadrunner_Hunter."
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000080">Refer to your hometown or state.</FONT></LI>

<BR>If your name is Casper and you happen to live in Wyoming, you might
request a User ID such as "Casper_Wyoming."
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000080">Refer to your own sense of style.</FONT></LI>

<BR>If you consider yourself a person of tremendous strength, you might
request a User ID such as "Man-of-Steel."
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
<A NAME="11"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Will anyone else have the same User ID?</FONT>
<BR>No. A User ID must be unique. In the real world, there can be thousands
of people named "Robert." At eBay, only one person can have "Robert" as
a User ID.

<P><A NAME="12"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Can my User ID be my e-mail address?</FONT>
<BR>Yes. Your User ID may be your registered e-mail address. Hence, the
embargo on the "@" symbol in User IDs (see above). This will prevent anyone
else from using your e-mail address as his/her User ID. If anyone chooses
to use an e-mail address as his/her User ID, it must match his/her registered
e-mail address.

<P><A NAME="13"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>I wanted to use "eBay" in my User ID.
Why cant I?</FONT>
<BR>Only eBay employees may use "eBay" in their User IDs. This is to prevent
anyone from appearing as though he/she were an employee of eBay.

<P><A NAME="14"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What if I am offended by someone elses
User ID?</FONT>
<BR>Contact Customer Support at <A HREF="mailto:support@ebay.com">support@ebay.com</A>.
eBay does not allow obscenities, profanity or hateful language in User
IDs. <A HREF="#9">(See above)</A>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">FINDING MY FRIENDS</B></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="28"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I find the e-mail address of 
someone with a User ID?<BR></FONT>
Simply click on that persons User ID. Enter your User ID or registered e-mail 
address and your eBay password, and eBay will show you that persons registered 
e-mail address. </P>

<P><A NAME="29"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What if I am a seller in a Dutch Auction? <BR></FONT>
We will provide the e-mail addresses of your Dutch Auction winners to you in 
the End of Auction Notice. And we will also make it possible for you to access 
the e-mail addresses of Dutch Auction bidders online through the item pages. 
You will not be required to make multiple requests.</P>

<P><A NAME="30"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What if I am a seller in several auctions and 
I need the e-mail addresses of several bidders?<BR></FONT>
eBay will provide a page through which you will be able to request multiple e-mail addresses. 
This page will only require you to enter your User ID and your eBay password 
<I>once</I>.&nbsp; You will not be required to make multiple requests.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">CHANGING MY LOOK...</B></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="15"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Can I change my User ID?</FONT>
<BR>Yes. When you change your User ID, eBay will give you a pair of "shades"
to help you tell other eBay users about your new look. The shades icon
will appear after your User ID for 30 days. During this time, your old
User ID will be "embargoed." No one else will be able to use your old User
ID until the 30-day period has expired.

<P><A NAME="16"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What does the "Shades" icon mean?</FONT>
<BR>The "shades" icon behind a User ID signifies that the user has changed
his/her User ID within the last 30 days. The "shades' icon will appear
after a User ID for 30 days following a successful change in User ID.

<P><A NAME="17"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What should I do if I see a "Shades"
icon?</FONT>
<BR>Click on it! The "shades" icon behind a User ID means that person has
changed his/her User ID within the last 30 days. Clicking on the "shades"
icon will allow you to see that persons User ID history. This information
will help you keep track of your friends and trading partners.

<P><A NAME="18"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>If I change my User ID, how soon can
I use the new User ID?</FONT>
<BR>Immediately. Your new User ID will be reflected in any auction in which
you are participating. For example, suppose your User ID is "John," and
you are the seller of a lamp. When you change your User ID to "Jane," the
auction will then show "Jane" as the seller of the lamp even if the auction
is currently running. Also, the "shades" icon will appear after "Jane"
for 30 days following your successful change in User ID.

<P><A NAME="20"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How often can I change my User ID?</FONT>
<BR>A User ID may not be changed more than once in a 30-day period. This
is to prevent confusion - mostly for the rest of us. There may be a very
good reason for you to change your User ID more than once in 30 days. Please
contact <A HREF="mailto:support@ebay.com">support@ebay.com </A> for help and explain your situation to them.

<P>But we must caution you against frequently changing your User ID. Your
User ID is a valuable asset to participating on eBay. You may find that
your trading partners will come to recognize you by your User ID and associate
certain characteristics with your User ID, much like they might with your
Feedback Rating. Given this, you may want to choose a User ID that is suitable
for a long, successful life on eBay.

<P>Choose a User ID that is suitable for a long, successful life on eBay.
And choose wisely!

<P><A NAME="21"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I change my User ID?</FONT>
<BR>Simply go to the <A HREF="\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?ChangeUserId">Change
User ID page </A>and follow the instructions.

<P><A NAME="22"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Can eBay change my User ID?</FONT>
<BR>eBay reserves the right to modify, alter or suspend any User ID at
any time, at our sole discretion and without notice, for any reason whatsoever.

<P><A NAME="23"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Does eBay keep track of all my User ID
changes?</FONT>
<BR>Yes. When you change your User ID, you create a User ID history which
is accessible by any registered eBay user. You can see any
<A HREF="\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?GetUserEmail"> user's User ID to show the history.</a>

<P>A User ID history may look something like this:</P>
<P>User ID: Norma Jean Baker<BR>Effective Date: Feburary 1, 1998<BR>
End Date: Feburary 7, 1998</P>
<P>User ID: Marilyn Monroe<BR>Effective Date: Feburary 7, 1998<BR>
End Date: Present</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">MAKING OTHER CHANGES...</FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="24"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Does my Feedback Rating follow me when
I change my User ID?</FONT>
<BR>Yes. Much like changing your registered e-mail address, changing your
User ID will prompt eBay to transfer your Feedback Rating and other important
account information to your new User ID.

<P><A NAME="25"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What if I want to change my registered
e-mail address?</FONT>
<BR>If you change your registered e-mail address, you can still keep the
same User ID. eBay allows you to use your registered e-mail address and
your User ID interchangeably. This means that wherever you are asked for
your registered e-mail address, you may provide your User ID  and vice
versa.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">PROTECTING US FROM SHILL BIDDING</B></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="19"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Wont this make it easier for shill bidders
to hide?</FONT>
<BR>No. If someone changes his/her User ID, it is reflected immediately
in a current auction.

<P>For example, "Sylvia" is the seller in an auction and wants to change
her User ID to "Cybill" to shill bid. Sylvia successfully changes her User
ID to Cybill and goes to bid on her own item. No problem, right? Wrong.
Sylvia gets to the Item Page and sees that Cybill is now listed as the
seller. So, shill bidding as Cybill isnt any easier than shill bidding
as Sylvia.

<P>Also, the "shades" icon will follow a new User ID for 30 days. This
is to alert other eBay users of that persons new look. And, like a persons
Feedback History, eBay has provided you an easy, accessible User ID History.
You may view your own or any other eBay users User ID History at any time.

<P><A NAME="26"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How does this prevent someone from bidding
on an item, changing his/her User ID, and bidding again?</FONT>
<BR>lets go back to Sylvia.

<P>"Sylvia" is the seller in an auction and wants to change her User ID
to "Cybill" to shill bid. Sylvia successfully changes her User ID to Cybill
and goes to bid on her own item. No problem, right? Wrong. Sylvia gets
to the Item Page and sees that Cybill is now listed as the seller. So,
shill bidding isnt any easier for Cybill than shill bidding is for Sylvia.

<P><A NAME="27"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What will eBay do to help protect me
from someone changing his/her User ID to shill bid?</FONT>
<BR>eBay uses the "shades" icon to let you know that someone has changed
his/her User ID. An auction can last three, five or seven days. But when
you change your User ID, the "shades" icon will appear after your name
for 30 days to alert other users of your new look.

<P>When you see a "shades" icon, click on it! Clicking on the shades icon
will allow you to see that persons User ID history. This information will
help you keep track of your friends and trading partners.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">GETTING MY USER ID...</B></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="31"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Im excited about the User IDs. 
Can I reserve mine?<BR></FONT></B>
Were excited too. But eBay isnt reserving nicknames. Well let you know well 
in advance when User IDs become available!</P>

<P><A NAME="32"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Ive got an idea. Im going to register additonal 
e-mail addresses to reserve User IDs! Ill even sell them!<BR></FONT></B>
Registering additional e-mail addresses for the purpose of "reserving" User IDs 
for future sale will result in "Trial by Skippy" (judge, jury, executioner) 
and the immediate use of the Weapon of Mass Destruction, with permanent affects.</P>

<P><A NAME="33"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>I still have more questions...<BR></FONT></B>
If you still have more questions, visit the 
<A HREF="\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?ViewBoard&name=uifeedback">
eBay User-Interface Feedback Board</A>. Someone will be there to answer your 
questions. Or e-mail your question to <A HREF="mailto:support@ebay.com">support@ebay.com</A>.</P>
