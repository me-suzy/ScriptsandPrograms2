<h2>Ending your auction</h2>

Use this form if you want to end your auction early. You should be aware
that many bidders wait until the very last minute to bid, in an effort to avoid
being outbid, so you may lose a potential buyer by doing this.
<p>

Ending your auction early does not relieve you of the obligation to sell
this item to the highest bidder. Please be aware that you will both be
notified via e-mail of the auction results. If you are ending the auction
because you have secured a better price elsewhere, you are advised to place
a bid on behalf of your other buyer, in order to secure the highest bid.
