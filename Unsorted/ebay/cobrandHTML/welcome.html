<td valign=top>
<tt>

I launched \$FULLNAME on Labor Day, 1995. Since then, this site has become more popular
than I ever expected, and I began to realize that this was indeed a <strong>grand
experiment</strong>
in Internet commerce.
<p>

By creating an open market that encourages <strong>honest</strong> dealings, I hope to
make it easier to conduct business with strangers over the net.
<p>

Most people are honest. And they mean well. Some people go
out of their way to make things right. I've heard great
stories about the honesty of people here. But some people
are dishonest. Or deceptive. This is true here, in the newsgroups, in the
classifieds, and right next door. It's a fact of life.
<p>

But here, those people <strong>can't hide.</strong> We'll
drive them away. Protect others from them. This grand hope
depends on your <strong>active</strong> participation.
Become a registered user. Use our feedback forum. Give
praise where it is due; make complaints where appropriate.
<p>

For the past six months, I've been developing this system
single-handedly, in my spare time. Along the way, I've
dealt with complaints among participants. But those
complaints have amounted to only a handful. We've had close
to <strong>10,000</strong> auctions since opening. And only
a few dozen complaints.
<p>

Now, we have an <strong>open forum.</strong> Use it. Make your complaints in the open. Better yet, give
your praise in the open. Let everyone know what a joy it was to deal with someone.
<p>

Above all, conduct yourself in a professional manner. Deal with others the way you would
have them deal with you. Remember that you are usually dealing with individuals, just like
yourself. Subject to making mistakes. Well-meaning, but wrong on occassion. That's just human.
We can live with that. We can deal with that. We can still <strong>make deals</strong> with that.
<p>

Thanks for participating. Good luck, and good business!
<p>

Regards,
<p>
