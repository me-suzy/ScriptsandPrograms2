<font color=green><i> *NOTE* - The below time estimates are reflective of
the amount of time spent <b>once we actually begin the investigation</b>.
There is a delay from the time you send an email until we actually
begin.</i></font><br><br>

<font color=red size=5><b>Stage 1: Receipt</b></font> Estimate - 5 -20 minutes
<p>This is the first step in the investigative process. In this step we
receive your email/fax and after reading it,  assess whether we have enough
information to proceed. We require the seller's full email address and the
full email addresses of any involved bidders or other parties (the "
Reported Parties"). Please remember to send us item numbers (or at least a
representative sample). Be sure to mention any irregularities you
notice.</p>
<br>
<p><font color=green><b> If at this point, we do not have sufficient
information to proceed, we will contact you for additional information. If
additional information is not available we will attempt to follow through
with what we have. If nothing turns up in a reasonable amount of time, the
investigation will be closed. In the event new information comes forward we
will reopen the investigation. </b></font></p><br><br>

<p><i><b>There are, of course, many cases where the information given is
more than sufficient to warrant skipping ahead through the stages. Many
shilling cases start at Receipt and then move directly to Resolve. These
stages are only a general guideline. And, as in all things, necessity and
circumstance will dictate the actual steps taken. We will always proceed in
a manner to bring resolution as quickly as possible.</b></i></p><br><br>

<font color=red size=5><b> Stage 2: Review</b></font> Estimate - 20 minutes
- 2 hours
<p>During this stage we review any and all records we have for the Reported
Parties. Have they been previously warned for this action? Have any of them
been suspended before, but reinstated with conditions? Have they violated
their conditions? </p>
<br>
<p><font color=green><b> If at this point, we discover that the Reported
Parties have been warned or previously suspended for the behavior, we will
quickly run through the following steps to verify another occurrance and an
<font color=red>eBay Registration Suspension</font> will then be issued for
the behavior. Otherwise the investigation continues.</b></font></p><br><br>

<font color=red size=5><b> Stage 3: Verify</b></font> Estimate - 30 minutes
- 3 hours
<p> In this stage we retrieve the registration information on the Reported
Parties for verification. We examine the following: Is the information
correct? Is the information complete? Is there any suspect information? Is
any of the information simply patently ridiculous? (Does the user claim he
is Abraham Lincoln or Scoobie Doo? Is his  address on the moon?)</p>
<br>
<p><font color=green><b> If at this point, we find any suspect information,
we will verify that information by all means possible to us. If the
information is still suspect, an <font color=red>eBay Registration
Suspension</font> will be issued for false information. Otherwise the
investigation continues.</b></font></p><br><br>

<font color=red size=5><b> Stage 4: Feedback</b></font> Estimate - 15
minutes - 2 hours
<p> In Feedback we begin checking the feedback history and interactions
between the players. We are looking to see if the feedback shows a track
record of the activity. Is there any suspect feedback? Is feedback shilling
or bombing involved?</p>
<br>
<p><font color=green><b> If at this point we find suspect information, we
will verify that information by all means possible to us. If the
information is still suspect an <font color=red> eBay Registration
Suspension</font> will be issued for Feedback shilling or bombing.
Otherwise the investigation continues.</b></font></p><br><br>

<font color=red size=5><b> Stage 5: Resolve</b></font> Estimate - 15
minutes - 5 hours (or more)
<p>We fully check and cross-reference the histories of the Reported
Parties. We verify whether shill bidding, bid manipulation or bid shielding
is taking place. We also separate coincidental appearances from the actual
occurrances.</p>
<br>
<p><font color=green><b> If we find that Shill Bidding, Bid Manipulation or
Bid Shielding occurred we will make a decision based upon the number of
occurrances, whether the seller is self bidding using their own ID or
another. If the behavior has just started or they are using their own ID,
then an <font color=red> eBay Procedural Warning</font> will be issued for
Bid Shilling or Bid Manipulation. Otherwise, an <font color=red> eBay
Registration Suspension</font> will be issued for Shill Bidding, Bid
Manipulation or Bid Shielding. </b></font></p><br><br>

<p>All reported suspect behavior is examined on a case by case basis,
because they are all so very different. We attempt to resolve accusations
as quickly as possible based on all the information at our disposal. If we
are unsure, no action is taken. Please remember that we are investigating
multiple cases simultaneously; some take only 15-20 minutes, while others
may require many days of focused effort to extract the necessary
information and look for patterns.<p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Some cases are blatant and obvious and require little work. Others are
very tedious and well hidden. We will typically ATTEMPT to contact you with
results of the investigation.  However, please understand that for legal
reasons we cannot always discuss details of the result of the
investigation.  In most of these cases,  we have already taken disciplinary
action.</p><br>

<p>Finally, should you not agree with our final assessment and action (or
inaction) regarding a given investigation, please remember that we have to
approach each case with a balanced and hopefully objective viewpoint. We
must be fair to everyone involved. Repeated inquiries regarding the outcome
of the investigation will only hinder this process.</p>
