<dt><strong><a href=\${HTMLPATH}add-to-item.html>Add to your item's description</a></strong>
<dd>If you've left something out of your item's description, use this link
to add to it. Note that you cannot change your previous description or item title,

arises with your bidders.

 and the actual item cannot be changed.

being outbid, so you may lose a potential buyer by doing this.
