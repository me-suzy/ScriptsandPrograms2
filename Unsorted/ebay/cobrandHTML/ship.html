<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1">AuctionShip Frequently Asked Questions</B></FONT></P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. What is AuctionShip?
<BR></FONT></I>A. AuctionShip provides eBay customers with online packing and shipping quotes at very affordable rates. Presently, we have 400 AuctionShip Centers in the network and an additional 250 stores will be added to the system by March 31, 1998</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Is AuctionShip the same as UPS or the United States Postal Service?
<BR></FONT></I>A. No. AuctionShip is a group of independently owned and operated businesses who specialize in packaging and shipping. </P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. If we must pay AuctionShip a surcharge, why not go directly to UPS or USPS?
<BR></FONT></I>A. Convenience, time savings and online tracking are three key reasons why you might prefer AuctionShip. Trips to the nearest UPS depot or time waiting at home for a pickup will cost you time you could be spending selling or otherwise growing your business.&nbsp; </P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Are there any additional advantages to using AuctionShip rather than going directly to the carriers?
<BR></FONT></I>A. AuctionShip locations can take the time to understand your needs and work with you.&nbsp; As small business owners, our affiliates can adapt our systems to meet your needs. Think of an AuctionShip Center as a resource to help you to sell more goods. If delivery of your sold items to your buyers is streamlined and pro
fessional, your customers are happy and your credibility rises. Some of you larger volume eBay sellers may even want us to be your fullfillment center in some cases.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. If AuctionShip prices are only slightly higher than your carriers, why are you in this business?
<BR></FONT></I>A. We believe that a significant number of high volume eBay sellers can use our system as fulfillment operations for distributing their products. Outsourcing your distribution functions may prove to be a better use of your time, resulting in greater profits for your business.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Are AuctionShip prices similar across the country?
<BR></FONT></I>A. AuctionShip prices are identical across the country as long as you are an eBay customer generating quotes through the AuctionShip System.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. How are AuctionSHIP rates determined?
<BR></FONT></I>A. All quotes are based on your answers to the AuctionSHIP questions; any AuctionSHIP location may adjust the prices (up or down) if you have inadvertently entered incorrect data.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. What are the AuctionSHIP quote options?
<BR></FONT></I>A. Three separate quoting paths are currently available: Shipping only, Packaging only, and Packaging and Shipping combined.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. What do these quotes include?
<BR></FONT></I>A. &quot;Shipping only&quot; quotes include just shipping from point to point and optional declared value coverage. &quot;Packaging only&quot; quotes are separated into packaging supplies and packaging services. The &quot;Packaging AND Shipping&quot; quote path includes ALL packaging supplies, expert packaging service and freight via UPS or USPS. PLUS you have ready access to AuctionSHIP's special online tracking system, by just entering your eBay item number. Optional declared value coverage is not included, but is strongly recommended in most cases, to protect you in case of damage or loss during shipping.</P><P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q.&nbsp; How man
y shipping options does AuctionSHIP offer?
<BR></FONT></I>A.&nbsp; Typically an AuctionSHIP quote will offer four UPS shipping options:
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">*</FONT>&nbsp; UPS Ground
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">*</FONT>&nbsp; UPS 3-Day
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">*</FONT>&nbsp; UPS 2-Day Air
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">*</FONT>&nbsp; UPS Next Day Air.
<BR>Usually, although not always, speed of delivery and cost are directly related. We also offer all USPS shipping options.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Does AuctionShip offer a pick-up service?
<BR></FONT></I>A. This service is offered in certain cities.&nbsp; Prices are not standardized, however as in the AuctionShip program. Please e-mail us at our AuctionSHIP URL <A HREF="http://www.auctionship.com">http://www.auctionship.com</A>. and we will try to match your request with the appropriate service advice.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. If I want to ship my items USPS, can I use AuctionShip?
<BR></FONT></I>A. USPS includes US Mail shipping charges for your item based on the expected weight and size after packaging. No value coverage is included in the charge and mail cannot currently be tracked. This service is for the user who may want professional help with packaging their item before shipping it Priority Mail through a convenient, friendly shipping center. USPS is also an option when the value of you items is low or if they are small items.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Would I save money by packaging the item I am selling myself?
<BR></FONT></I>A. If your items are small, not fragile, low in value, and you have the time, then yes, you may save money by packing yourself. If you are an infrequent shipper of low value, non fragile items and your time allows, it may make sense to you to do it yourself and save money. If you frequently sell the same products and you have the time and desire, you can either package the items yourself to save dollars or use our system as your outsource &quot;shipping room&quot; if the economics prove cost effective for your sales v
olume. If self-packaging is your choice, AuctionShip Centers can provide you with the packaging materials to make the job easier for you.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Why should I use AuctionShip for packaging?
<BR></FONT></I>A. Use AuctionShip to assure that your fragile and/or higher value items are well protected for their journey as well as to save time. Avoiding damage or loss is a huge stress reliever and your customers will not be disappointed when they open the box. An important fact about buying declared value is that it does not ensure that you will receive a full refund check in the event of damage.&nbsp; All packaging jobs must meet the carriers standards to avoid being labelled &quot;insufficient packaging&quot; during an inspection. Certainly, if you think you can do it, enjoy doing it and have the time, go for it!&nbsp; But do check each carriers service guide for rules and regulations.</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1">United Parcel Service Frequently Asked Questions</B></FONT></P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. I am a new eBay customer and would like to qualify for a UPS account. How do I do this?
<BR></FONT></I>A. You may call for information about setting up a new UPS account at 1-800-742-5877 and ask for current UPS service guides. You may also get information on the UPS website at <A HREF="http://www.ups.com">http://www.ups.com</A>.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Sometimes when I ship to my customers, packages are left on the doorstep or nearby.&nbsp; Other customers tell me that they get a notice to come to UPS to pick up my shipment and they are annoyed.&nbsp; Can you explain this to me?
<BR></FONT></I>A. UPS will try to deliver to an address three times on three different days. After the third time, a notice will be left for the consignee (receiver of the package) to come to the UPS depot to pick up the package. Sometimes the UPS driver will leave the package in a place out of view (like behind a bush) and out of weather (in the garage), but only in what are considered &quot;saf
e areas&quot; such as cities with low crime rates or single family neighborhoods.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Why do I get charged for an address correction?
<BR></FONT></I>A. Having to correct an address disrupts a packages travels through the UPS system to its destination. An UPS employee must remove the package from the automated system, set it aside and then manually look up the consignee in the local telephone book. This costs time and money.&nbsp; UPS strives to train shippers to carefully address each package and even put the address inside the box in case the box gets damaged or the outside address gets obliterated. Clear addresses, inside and out, assure speedy delivery to your buyers.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. As a higher volume shipper, do I qualify for the UPS Hundredweight Service? I have heard others talk about it?
<BR></FONT></I>A. The UPS Hundredweight program applies to multiple piece ground shipments totaling 200 pounds or more, sent to a single address on the same day. Rates are based on total shipment weight and are 50% lower than published LTL rates (&quot;less than truckload&quot; carriers like Roadway, ABF and Bekins). Call your local UPS sales representative to see if you qualify.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. I have always thought that if I bought &quot;insurance&quot; from UPS, no matter what happened, I would get reimbursed for my loss. Is this the case or not?
<BR></FONT></I>A. UPS has special packaging standards which must be observed in order for a damage claim to be honored. You will find specific requirements for proper packaging in our service guide (pages 34-39) and on our UPS website. If you follow the rules, claims will be minimal, but if you should encounter a claim, proper packaging techniques will ensure your reimbursement after UPS' inspection of the package.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Sometimes I am asked if I want &quot;insurance&quot; and sometimes I am asked if I want &quot;declared value&quot; to protect my item. What's the difference?
<BR></FONT></I>A. &quot;Declared Value&quot; covers replacement or repair cost only if the item was packaged according to carrier standards as described in carrier service guides or websites. It covers a value that can be substantiated with a receipt or appraisal and is exclusive of sentimental value. &quot;Insurance&quot; implies coverage under all circumstances, like the insurance you buy at the post office. These two terms are commonly misstated and misused. The coverage you purchase from UPS is always declared value, not insurance.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. Is UPS ground service really that much better than the US Mail?
<BR></FONT></I>A.UPS tracks shipments from the time they leave your door and you can follow your shipment online via the UPS website. On time delivery standards are stringent and UPS provides $100 declared value coverage on your package inclusive in the shipping charge.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. What is &quot;dimensional weight&quot; and when does it apply?
<BR></FONT></I>A. The dimensional weight rule applies for UPS shipments traveling via 3 Day, 2 Day, Next Day or Worldwide service. For these services, dimensional weight would apply to your package if it's weight based on its size is greater than the actual weight of the package. Consider a large, 2 pound box filled with feathers sitting in the back of a UPS package car. Next to it is a small, 2-pound box. Even though the boxes actual weights are the same, the larger box &quot;dimensionally&quot; weighs more and is rated higher because it takes up more space in the truck.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. How do I know if my box will be charged at dimensional rates?
<BR></FONT></I>A.For domestic shipments, the Dimensional weight formula is L x W x H/194. For International shipments, the formula is:&nbsp; L x W x H/166. Check the UPS service guide, page 33 or the UPS website. Always think about box size as it relates to the dimensional rule, but never compromise your packaging job to downsize and save money.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q
. Can I ship items in used boxes, and if I do, will a claim be honored by UPS if there is damage?
<BR></FONT></I>A. Here is a list from the UPS service guide that should keep you on the straight and narrow regarding these types of issues. We require: Rigid cartons with flaps intact (so if your used box is flabby and soft, put it in the recycle!) Items in the box wrapped separately. Adequate cushioning material. Strong shipping tape. No string or brown paper. Single, clearly written address label inside and out. Clear, complete return address label. If you follow these rules you should not encounter any claims headaches.</P>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Q. I sell tiny, unbreakable, wooden ornaments and I'd like to put them in your Next Day Air Letter Envelope for fast delivery during the holiday season. They would fit nicely and this would be cost effective for me.
<BR></FONT></I>A. Sorry, the Next Day Envelope you mention is for documents only. These envelopes must remain flat and standard in size in order for them to travel swiftly through our automated system. Our Next Day Air Express Box is perfect for a wide variety of merchandise and can hold up to 30 pounds.</TD>
