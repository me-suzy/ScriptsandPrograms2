<h2>\$HOMENAME Adults Only Information</h2>

\$HOMENAME has a listing category known as <strong>Erotic,
Adults Only.</strong> Like all listings at \$HOMENAME, listings
in this category are the sole responsibility of the seller,
and \$HOMENAME does not verify, endorse, or recommend any
of the items therein.
<p>

We created this category so that users could avoid (or seek
out) this merchandise as they wish. Prior to the existence of
this category, such items were listed in Miscellaneous, making
accidental exposure more likely.
<p>

We don't take a moral stand on the items which are listed at
\$HOMENAME -- we act only as a listing agent. If users
are offended by the material herein, such as smut, porn, 
adult, erotic, or sexual content, they are encouraged to
avoid accessing this category.
<p>

Items listed in this category are omitted from the New Items
page, but they still appear in chronological order with a
NEW icon in the appropriate section. They are also omitted
from the HOT section. In this way, we attempt to avoid offending
users who may be sensitive to this subject matter.
