<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>What is not investigated,<br> and what you should do if
these happen.</B></H3>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p> Here you will find many of the things that we do not investigate. These
include simple misunderstandings, failures to communicate, user to user
conflicts, and other acts which eBay has no control over. Also included is
eBay's recommendations on how to deal with items such as this.</p>

<ul>

<font color=red><li>I have never had a transaction with this person before,
and they left a negative feedback.
<li>The other party left negative feedback on me after I left it on them. I
was the injured party, not them!
<li>I want this negative feedback removed and I want it removed NOW!</font>
<ul><p> We are afraid eBay cannot remove these comments. Per our legal
disclaimer, we do not  edit public postings.</p>

<p>  We do sympathize with your predicament. It is awful to have such
comments in what was a top notch feedback profile or a "perfect" record.
What you might do is to post a reply to your own profile. That way, anyone
looking at your feedback will see your side of the story. If it is any
consolation, any user with good sense will see through this one incident
and recognize the general pattern of positive transactions that you have
had. Please remember, it is never appropriate to raise your own feedback
through the use of your own or another registration in order to repair a
negative feedback. It is standard practice and good eBay etiquette to use a
neutral comment to explain such occurrances.</p>

<p> We hope this helps you to understand our policy.</p>
</ul>
<br>
<font color=red><li>Seller is charging too much shipping.
<li>The seller insists that I: Pay in advance, unhide my feedback before
accepting my bid, etc. (you get the idea.)</font>
<ul><p>If the seller has a stated policy concerning shipping and payment
terms on the item listing, then you as bidder must clear any exceptions to
this before actually bidding. If the seller does not wish to make an
exception, that is their right. You should, therefore, simply refuse to bid
on the item.</p></ul>

<font color=red><li>The seller refuses to answer my emails, they will not
acknowledge my winning bid, or they have already sold the item.</font>
<ul><p>eBay cannot force a seller to honor their auctions. You should of
course, leave appropriate feedback for the reluctant seller to warn other
bidders of his or her past history. We will, at your request, also inquire
directly to the seller for an explanation as well. Depending on your local
jurisdiction, you may have independant legal recourse against the
seller.</p></ul>

<font color=red><li>The bidder insists that I: Ship COD, Accept a third
party post-dated
                  check, box each item separately, etc. (you get this idea
too.)</font>
<ul><p>eBay cannot force a bidder to honor their bid but you can alert the
rest of the eBay community of your experience by leaving the recalcitrant
bidder appropriate feedback. You may also either offer the item to the next
bidder or you may relist it and request a credit for the Final Value Fee by
following the instructions at: 
<a href="\${HTMLPATH}credreq.html">http://cayman.ebay.com/aw/credreq.html</a>
 </p></ul>

<font color=red><li>The seller took my money and I still don't have
anything to show for it.</font>
<font color=red><li>Just look at this, he didn't ship my item, he has my
money and his feedback shows he has done this a lot of times to others,
what are you going to do about it?</font>
<ul><p> The vast majority of the thousands of transactions that take place
every day on eBay are trouble-free. Unfortunately, however, there are
occasional problems that users run into when dealing with strangers.
Luckily, most of those problems can be easily resolved. </p>

<p><i><b>**NOTE**</b></i> Beware of "SEND CASH ONLY" transactions. It is
more secure to use a postal money order or a consideration of COD, in order
to protect both parties.</p>

<p>Before you contact eBay with a complaint about another user, we ask that you
do the following:</p>

<p>Try to resolve your dispute: Most problems are a result of poor or
ineffective e-mail communication, as many people are not used to
communicating this way. You can exchange personal contact information,
including phone numbers, by accessing this link. </p>

</p>Contact another user: http://cayman.ebay.com/aw/user-query.html or by
clicking <a href="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">HERE</a></p>

<p>Arbitration information: If you feel the need to go to a third party for
resolution, please keep in mind that eBay is not a professional arbitrator
and cannot offer those services at this time. There are many excellent
options for arbitration, see Yahoo's page on
<a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Companies/Law/Arbitration_an
d_Mediation/">Arbitration Services.</a></p>

<p>Use the User Feedback Forum: It is very important to try to resolve
disputes directly with other users. If you are unable to do so, please
share your experience with the eBay community by using the User Feedback
Forum. Users with significant negative feedback are automatically prevented
from using the system in the future.</p>

<p>File a Formal Complaint: If mail fraud is involved (you have paid but
not received your merchandise), your local US Post Office or the National
Fraud Information Center <a
href="http://www.fraud.com/">(http://www.fraud.com/)</a> can help you
easily file a formal complaint. Please help prevent future fraud by filing
a complaint! <i><b>*NOTE*</b></i> eBay cannot take this step for you, we
cannot file fraud charges or instigate official actions on your behalf, you
must do this for yourself.</p>

<p>Send us a Copy of the Formal Complaint: Once you file a formal complaint
with the authorities, please send us a copy. We will then be able to take
immediate action to bar the user from our site. Be sure to include any
e-mail address(s) used by the user. </p>
<p><font color=blue><b>eBay Inc.<br>ATTN.: Fraud Prevention <br>2005
Hamilton Ave., Suite 350<br>San Jose, CA 95125</b></font></p>

<p>No Formal Complaint? </p>
<p>If you are not ready to file a formal complaint against the other user,
then the most appropriate avenue for your complaint is to try to resolve
your disputes with the other user, or use the User Feedback Forum to
publicly declare your complaint to the entire eBay community. </p>

<p>We cannot accept or take action on anonymous complaints. Please try to
resolve your disputes or use the User Feedback Forum as appropriate. You
may also make your fraud complaints to us in writing using the above
address, but we are not able to file formal charges on your behalf.
</p></ul>


<font color=red><li>Threatening/Nasty/False emails </font>
<ul><p>Email problems can not be handled by eBay. If you receive
threatening, obscene or fraudulent emails these must be reported to your
ISP (Internet Service Provider) and to the sending party's ISP. Most ISP's
have a specified email address for complaints of this type, usually
postmaster@isp.com, abuse@isp.com or root@isp.com (where isp.com is the
actual service provider's name IE. aol.com, msn.net, eee.org, etc.)
However, please do forward a copy  of any email that would be considered a
violation of eBay's rules or that points to fraudulent activity or
intent.<i><b>**NOTE**</b></i> This does not include SPAM.</p> </ul>


<font color=red><li>Bid Sniping (last minute bidding)</font>
<ul><p>eBay always recommends bidding the absolute maximum that one is
willing to pay for an item early in the auction. eBay uses a proxy bidding
system, you may bid as high as you wish, but the current bid that is
registered will only be a small increment above the next lowest bid. The
remainder of your Maximum Bid is held, by the system, to be used in the
event someone bids against you. For a full explanation of 
<a href="\${HTMLPATH}proxy-bidding.html"> Proxy Bidding click
here.</a> Thus, if one is outbid, one should be at worst, ambivilent toward
being outbid. After all, someone else was simply willing to pay more than
you wanted to pay for it. If someone does outbid you toward the last
minutes of an auction, it may feel unfair, but if you had bid your maximum
amount up front and let the Proxy Bidding system work for you, the outcome
would not be based on time.</p></ul>

<font color=red><li>Almost everything else that is not in the list for what
TO report.</font>
<ul><p>Any technical questions, billing questions etc, should be sent to
the appropriate e-mail address to avoid delays. You may find the proper
contacts  <a href="\${HTMLPATH}contact.html">here</a></p></ul>
