<h2>Complaints about other eBay users</h2>

The large majority of the thousands of transactions that take place every day on eBay are trouble-free. Unfortunately, however, there are occasional problems that users run into when dealing with strangers. Luckily, most of those problems can be easily resolved.
<p>

Before you contact eBay with a complaint about another user, we ask that you do the following:
<p>

<table width=98%>

<tr>
<td width=5%></td>
<td valign=top>
<b>Try to resolve your dispute</b><br>
<font size=-1>Most problems are a result of poor or ineffective e-mail communication, as many people are not used to communicating this way. You can exchange personal contact information, including phone numbers, by accessing this link.</font>
</td>

<td align=left width=20%><a href="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">Contact another user</a></td>
<td width=5%></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<td valign=top>
<b>Arbitration information</b><br>
<font size=-1>If you feel the need to go to a third party for resolution, please keep in mind that eBay is not a professional arbitrator and cannot offer those services at this time. There are many excellent options for arbitration, and we like Yahoo's page on <a href=http://www.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Companies/Law/Arbitration_and_Mediation/>Arbitration Services</a>.</font>

<tr>
<td width=5%></td>
<td valign=top>
<b>Use the User Feedback Forum</b><br>
<font size=-1>It is very important to try to resolve disputes directly with other users. If you are unable to do so, please share your experience with the eBay community by using the User Feedback Forum. Users with significant negative feedback are automatically prevented from using the system in the future.</font>

<td valign=top>
<b>File a Formal Complaint</b><br>
<font size=-1>If mail fraud is involved (you have paid but not received your merchandise), your local U.S. Post Office or the National Fraud Information Center can help you easily file a formal complaint. Please help prevent future fraud by filing a complaint!</font>

<td width=5%></td>
<td valign=top>
<b>Send us a Copy of the Formal Complaint</b><br>
<font size=-1>Once you file a formal complaint with the authorities, please send us a copy. We will then be able to take immediate action to bar the user from our site. Be sure to include any e-mail address(es) used by the user.</font>

<b>No Formal Complaint?</b><br>
<font size=-1>If you are not ready to file a formal complaint against the other user, then the most appropriate avenue for your complaint is to try to <a href="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">resolve your disputes</a> with the other user, or use the <a href="http://206.79.255.84/aw/feedback-login.html">User Feedback Forum</a> to publically declare your complaint to the entire eBay community.<p>

We cannot accept or take action on anonymous complaints. Please try to <a href="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">resolve your disputes</a> or use the <a href="\${HTMLPATH}feedback-login.html">User Feedback Forum</a> as appropriate. You may also make your fraud complaints to us in writing using the above address, but we are not able to file formal charges on your behalf.
