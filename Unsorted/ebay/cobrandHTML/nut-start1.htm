Welcome to eBay!</font></p>

<p>At eBay, we help you trade!</p>

<p>In fact, for over two years we have helped thousands of buyers and sellers exchange
goods using our dynamic auction classifieds. Through your efforts, eBay has become the
largest person-to-person trading area on the Internet.</p>

<p>Not only is eBay the leader in this area, but it is also the longest running and the
most innovative. Thanks goes out to our users who continually find ways to improve the
service and make this site one of the most fun, dynamic and rewarding experiences on the
Web.</p>

<p>So, thank you for visiting. Let's get started. </p>

</ul>

<p>This new user tutorial has been designed to introduce you to the basics of our auction
classifieds and get you up to speed within minutes. </p>

<p>You can go through it one area at a time, or if you like, you can do all four in one
sitting. After you've gone through it, you will need to read the <a
href="\${HTMLPATH}rules.html">auction rules</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, some of these screens may not match exactly with what you see at eBay. We have
tried to simplify this tutorial to give you a quick overview of the system.</p>

<p>So, when you're ready, click on the <a href="nut-register1.html">Next</a> arrow below and
we'll begin.</p>
