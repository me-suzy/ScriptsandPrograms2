<A NAME="21"></A><B>How do I find out how my auction ended?</B></DT>

<DD>
Auction results are available on the original item's description screen,
for up to 30 days after the scheduled close of the auction. If you have
the item number, you can use the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}search.html">search</A>
feature to look up the item directly. Even if you've lost the item number,
the same search feature will let you look up the item by name. You can
also use the item's direct URL, which was included in your listing or bidding
confirmation.</DD>

<p>
<DT>
<A NAME="1"></A><B>What do I do if I can't contact the seller/buyer by
e-mail?</B></DT>

<DD>
If you are both <A HREF="\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterShow">registered
users</A>, you can ask eBay to send each of you both persons' contact
information. One  e-mail message will be sent to both of you containing
the contact information each user entered when he/she registered. This
information is for use only in handling eBay Auction Web-related matters. Follow
this link to the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">eBay
user query</A> page. If one of you is not a registered user, there is nothing
we can do that you could not do yourself, unfortunately. For example, you
might try contacting the user's service provider, or using a <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">search
engine</A> to track down the name and location of the user.</DD>

<p>
<DT>
<A NAME="2"></A><B>How can I stop an auction immediately?</B></DT>

<DD>
Sellers can stop their auction immediately from the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}seller-services.html">Seller
Services</A> section of the Main menu.</DD>

<p>
<DT>
<A NAME="20"></A><B>I made a mistake when listing my item. What should
I do?</B></DT>

<DD>
You can either add to your item's description, or change its category,
or you can end the auction immediately and begin a new one. All options
are available on the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}seller-services.html">Sellers
menu</A>.</DD>

<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="3"></A><B>What if the seller doesn't want to sell anymore?</B></DT>

<DD>
<br>
Although this does not happen that frequently, since normally sellers are
eager to sell their merchandise, it can be disappointing when it happens.
If the seller is a registered user, and you have received confirmation
that they do indeed want to back out of the sale, then please <A HREF="mailto:aw@ebay.com">let
us know</A>. Sellers will lose their registered status if the refuse to
sell.</DD>
<BR>Keep in mind that many people don't access their e-mail daily, so they
may not be intentionally ignoring you if you don't hear from them. Use
our user <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">query form</A> to
get personal contact information.
<p>
<DT>
<A NAME="4"></A><B>What if the high-bidder doesn't want to buy anymore?</B></DT>

<DD>
If you've been unable to contact the high-bidder, even after requesting
their personal <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">contact information</A>,
then you may move on to the next bidders. If there are other bidders for
your item, you can contact them in the order in which they appear in your
item's bidding history. Please be sure to allow at least three business
days before moving on to the next bidder.</DD>

<BR>
The complete bidding history of any auction is always available, via
a link from the item's description page. You can use the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}search.html">search</A>
page to look up an item by number.
<BR>
Keep in mind that many people don't access their e-mail daily, so they
may not be intentionally ignoring you if you don't hear from them. Use
our user <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}user-query.html">query form</A> to

<BR>
If all efforts to sell your item fail, <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}credreq.html">request
a credit</A> for the listing fee due.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="23"></A><B>How do I pay eBay?</B></DT>

<DD>
Every day one of your auction ends, you will receive an advisory notice
about the listing fee that was added to your account for that auction.
You do not have to pay this fee right away, since many of our sellers use
eBay for more than one auction. Instead, on the First day of each
month, an e-mail invoice is sent to each account with a balance from the
prior month. You have until the 28th to pay that invoice.</DD>


<BR>The easiest way to maintain good standing with eBay is to open your
<A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}account.html">eBay account</A> with
a VISA or MasterCard. (Follow the preceding link for complete information
and instructions.) If you do not have a VISA or MasterCard, you may pay
by check or money order, by following the mailing instructions included
in the invoice.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="27"></A><B>How do I put pictures in my listings?</B></DT>

<DD>
This is how you would add an image to your item decription.</DD>

<OL>
<LI>
First, the image format must be .bmp, .jpg or .gif for most browsers to
"see" it. For photos, .jpg works best at small quick-loading files, and
for logo type graphics, use .gif. Your image software probably handles
this format; if not a good easy shareware program for PCs is LViewPro (Paint
Shop Pro is even better, especially if you use your digital camera a lot
-- it's excellent at "tweaking" images) -- try <A HREF="http://www.shareware.com">www.shareware.com</A>.</LI>

<LI>
Second -- you have to get the image uploaded to a server. If you already
have a webpage, storage space, and understand FTP, this is easy. If not,
then this is a problem...you might be able to get a Web page through your
ISP. You may also be able to receive help from Jane at <A HREF="mailto:pongo@ptialaska.net">pongo@ptialaska.net!</A>
She has offered to host images and to help users set up the proper html
coding for a price. You must have a digitized image that you can email
to her. eBay cannot be held liable for this third-party service, but it
may be an option for you.</LI>

<LI>
Finally, you must add HTML coding to your description, showing the entire
"path" back to the internet address where the image is located. Here is
an example:</LI>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;img src=http://www.ptialaska.net/~pongo/computers/drive.gif></PRE>
You can also simply put the URL http://www.ptialaska.net/~pongo/computers/drive.gif
in the field called "Picture URL" when you initially create your listing.</OL>

<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="29"></A><B>What happens if my item doesn't sell?</B></DT>

<DT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, over
70% of transactions on eBay are successfully completed, and we are confident
that your item will sell too. However, eBay is committed to guaranteeing
your satisfaction as a valued customer. Should your item not sell the first
time around, here's what we'll do for you:</DT>
</DL>

<DL>
<DL>
<LI>
You can <a href=\${HTMLPATH}seller-services.html#relist>relist your item </a>once more with us at <I>no additional charge.</I> Please
make sure the following conditions apply:</LI>

<DL>- You can relist your item within 30 days of the closing date of the
first auction.
<BR>- You didn't receive any bids on your listed item (for regular auction).
<BR>- You didn't receive an bids that met or exceeded your reserve price
( for Reserve auction).
<BR>- You listed the original item on or after December 1, 1997.</DL>

<LI>
Perhaps you want to come up with a snappier title, change the bid price,
or add a more detailed item description. You can revise any of the descriptive
features on the item and relist it. we'll waive the insertion fee one time
only.</LI>

<LI>
After the item sells, you will be charged the applicable Final Value Fee.
This offer is&nbsp; good for one relisting only, and the actual item cannot
be charged. Note that this offer does not apply to Dutch auction.</LI>
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="22"></A><B>What do I do about duplicate listings?</B></DT>

<DD>
Some users have reported that their listings have been duplicated during
submission. This usually happens because the server was very busy during
submission, and the user canceled the first submission to try again. Regardless
of how it happened, you will want to eliminate the duplicate listing.</DD>


<BR>To do so, use the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}seller-services.html">Sellers</A>
menu to <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}end-auction.html">end your auction</A>
early.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="5"></A><B>Why doesn't my listing show up right away?</B></DT>

<DD>
Your direct URL will be enabled immediately, but the index pages are only
update once per hour.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="6"></A><B>Why did my listing disappear?</B></DT>

<DD>
If the e-mail address you entered is invalid, or if there is a problem
in delivering the confirmation message that is automatically sent when
you place a listing, your listing will be automatically removed.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="7"></A><B>Why did my bid disappear?</B></DT>

<DD>
If the e-mail address you entered is invalid, or if there is a problem
in delivering the confirmation message that is automatically sent when
you place a bid, your listing will be automatically removed.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="15"></A><B>Why did I show up as high bidder again after I was
outbid?</B></DT>

<DD>
This happens if the bidder who outbid you entered an invalid e-mail address,
and the bid could not be verified.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="12"></A><B>Every time I make a bid, it says I was outbid immediately.
What's wrong?</B></DT>

<DD>
Actually, there is nothing wrong. What is happening is that an earlier
bidder specified a maximum bid higher than the maximum you just specified.
When you confirmed your bid, the other bidder's "proxy" immediately placed
a bid on his behalf, just enough to outbid your maximum, to ensure his
position as high bidder. When you place a bid with a maximum high enough
to outbid all other bidders, your proxy will protect your position in the
same way.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="8"></A><B>Why does it still say I am an unregistered user?</B></DT>

<DD>
After filling out the registration form, you will be sent a confirmation
message via e-mail. You must follow the instructions in that message to
complete your registration. This process ensures that your e-mail address
is correct and functional. Please allow at least thirty minutes to receive
your confirmation message. You'll need to confirm your registration with
the information you receive via e-mail, using <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}reg-confirm.html">this
confirmation form</A>.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="18"></A><B>I never confirmed my registration. What should I do?</B></DT>

<DD>
If you never confirmed your registration by following the instructions
given to you via e-mail, you will need to get those instructions again.
(The e-mail message contains a special password you will use with the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}reg-confirm.html">this
confirmation form</A> to show that you do in fact control the e-mail address
you used to register.)</DD>


<BR>To get another copy of the registration information and special password,
simply go back to the original <A HREF="\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterShow">registration
form</A> and enter only your e-mail address. You will be sent another e-mail
message with instructions on confirming your registration.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="16"></A><B>I have forgotten my user password. What do I do?</B></DT>

<DD>
You'll have to request a new password, which will be sent to you via e-mail.
See the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}registration.html">Registered User
Services</A> page for more options.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="17"></A><B>How do I change my e-mail address?</B></DT>

<DD>
We now have an online form which you can use to change your email address.
The form is on our <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}registration.html">Registered
User Services</A> menu, or you can access it directly by <A HREF="\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?ChangeEmail">this
link.</A></DD>


<BR>Changing your email address is a two step process. First, you enter
your old email, password and your new email address into our change of
email request form above. The system will then send you a verification
code to your new email address. You will then go to another page as directed
in the email and enter the code to complete your change of email process.
This is to ensure that your new email is correct and that you have control
of it before it is used.

<BR><B>NOTE: this is a change from our old procedure.</B> Please do <B>not</B>
register under the new email or you will not be able to use the form. If
you already registered under your new email, please contact support with
your old and new emails and passwords and they will combine the accounts
for you.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="26"></A><B>How do I change my address or phone number?</B></DT>

<DD>
We now have an online form which you can use to view or modify your registered
user information. The form is on our <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}registration.html">Registered
User Services</A> menu, or you can access it directly by <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}change-registration.html">using
this link.</A></DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="9"></A><B>Can I increase my maximum bid after I've placed a bid?</B></DT>

<DD>
Yes. Simply place a new bid with your new maximum. You won't be bidding
against yourself, so there is no need to worry.</DD>


<BR>In Dutch auctions new bids must have a higher value than previous bids.
The value of the bid is determined by multiplying the amount bid by the
number of items bid for. Reducing this total value in subsequent bids is
not permitted, and your new bid will be rejected.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="19"></A><B>Why is my Dutch auction bid not being accepted?</B></DT>

<DD>
In Dutch auctions new bids must have a higher value than previous bids.
The value of the bid is determined by multiplying the amount bid by the
number of items bid for. Reducing this total value in subsequent bids is
not permitted, and your new bid will be rejected.</DD>


<BR>This rule protects sellers from unscrupulous bidders who bid for the
entire quantity, thereby discouraging other bidders from participating,
and then reduce their quantity at the last minute.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="14"></A><B>Can I reduce or retract my bid once it has been placed?</B></DT>

<DD>
No. As stated several times during the bidding process, bids cannot be
retracted. The problem is that you are disrupting the auction and possible
causing financial harm to the seller if you back out of your bid. Please
read the <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}rules.html">eBay Auction Rules</A>
for complete information.</DD>


<BR>However, there are certain legitimate cases where a bid retraction may
be appropriate. Please see <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}retract-bid.html">this
document</A> for more information.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Can I change my item's description or category?</B></DT>

<DD>
Sellers can add to their items' descriptions or change the category at
any time. Please see our <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}seller-services.html">Seller
Services</A> section.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="24"></A><B>Can I change my item's starting price or quantity?</B></DT>

<DD>
Unfortunately, the initial parameters of an auction, such as starting price,
quantity, or reserve price, cannot be changed once the auction is underway.
You should carefully verify your listing before placing it. If necessary,
you should <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}end-auction.html">end your auction</A>
right away and place a new listing. The non-refundable insertion fee cannot
be credited just because you made an error in your listing.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="11"></A><B>I was very pleased/unhappy dealing with someone; what
should I do?</B></DT>

<DD>
If you'd like to give some public feedback, positive or negative, on another
AuctionWeb registered user, you can do so using our new <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}user-feedback.html">user
feedback</A> feature. More information about this feature is available
in our <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}registration.html">Registered User
Services</A> section.</DD>


<BR>If you are making a complaint about someone, please try to resolve the
conflict with that person directly before using the user feedback forum.
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="13"></A><B>What if my buyer backs out? Do I still owe a listing
fee?</B></DT>

<DD>
If you are unable to sell your item after contacting all the bidders, you
may be eligible for a credit of the listing fee. Please see our <A HREF="\${HTMLPATH}credreq.html">credit
request</A> form for more information.</DD>
<P>
<DT>
<A NAME="28"></A><B>Why is there a star next to a user's name?</B></DT>

<DD>
For users with a feedback rating of more than ten, a star is listed next
to their name. A user receives one point for every positive comment and
loses one point for every negative comment in their feedback profile. Remember,
you can click on the star or the number next to the user's name to see
all the feedback comments.</DD>
