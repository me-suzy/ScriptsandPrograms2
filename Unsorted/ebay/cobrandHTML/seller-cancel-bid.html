<h2>Cancelling bids placed in your \$HOMENAME auction</h2>

You may use this form to cancel bids placed in your auction, if you have a valid reason. Since all \$HOMENAME bids are <strong>binding,</strong> you should only cancel bids you have a good reason to cancel. Here are a few examples of a legitimate cancellation:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Bidder contacts you to back out of the bid.
<li>You cannot verify the identity of the bidder, after trying all reasonable means of contact.
</ul>

<p>

Cancellation will eliminate <strong>all</strong> bids placed by the bidder in this auction. If you are trying to correct an error in a bid, the bidder will have to bid again.

<h3>Explanation</h3>

Your cancellation will be publicized in the bidding history for this auction, and you may be asked to explain your cancellation to the bidder or other bidders. If the cancellation was not legitimate, you open yourself to potential negative feedback from other users.
<p>

For this reason, please include a concise (no more than one line) explanantion of your cancellation for inclusion in the official record. (The notation &quot;seller cancellation&quot; will appear automatically before your explanation.)
<p>

For your protection, you need a password in order to cancel a bid. If you haven't selected a personal password, or if you've forgotten your password, please <a href=\${HTMLPATH}reqpass.html>request a new temporary password</a> before proceeding.
