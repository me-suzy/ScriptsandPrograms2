<p>Dear eBay Community,

<p>As most of you are painfully aware, many companies of unknown repute have sent unsolicited commercial e-mail ("spam") to you in the past, and continue to do so. This continues to concern me greatly , since I value the privacy of our community. eBay has never used spam tactics to try to solicit new users from competitive sites, and we never will. I've always believed that spam reflects poorly on the spammer. As announced in the past, we are actively working to prevent this type of activity in the future, from both technological and legal fronts. I hope to be able to give you a good progress update in the next few weeks.

<p>Today, many of you received a spam for the first time from a well-known, publicly-traded company. Several months ago, this company approached us with a request to buy our list of users; of course, we refused. Later, they used a "robot" to collect your e-mail addresses, which also negatively affected the performance of our site; when we discovered this, we asked them to stop. I am disappointed that a company with such high standing would stoop to such a low level, and I hope you will join me in expressing that disappointment. While eBay has always emphasized treating our individual users with respect, other companies seem to believe you are just a mass of people with wallets in your back pockets that can be lured in by these tactics. I personally have always found such behavior insulting. 

<p>Here's what we are doing to address this particular incident, above and beyond our continuing work to address spam activity in general:

<ol>
<li>We are working with our legal counsel to prepare and deliver a formal letter of 
complaint.
<li>We would like your help to express our community's disappointment: please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:spam@ebay.com">spam@ebay.com</a> expressing your concerns.
<li>If you are an America Online user, you should let AOL know that you object to receiving spam from one of their partners: forward the spam you received to screen name TOSspam.
</ol>

<p>We want to send a clear message to this spammer as well as all spammers that our community does not welcome this activity, and that in fact we take offense. (As you know, spamming *by* eBay users is already a violation of our user agreement.) Unfortunately, I believe that despite our best efforts to prevent this activity in the future, we will always run the risk of being victimized by a new, more clever spammer. We must join together as a community and let them know that we will not tolerate such behavior.

<p>Regards,

<p>Pierre
