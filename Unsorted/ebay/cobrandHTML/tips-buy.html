<h2>Tips for Buyers</h2>

Buying merchandise through \$HOMENAME is a unique experience, and it has certain aspects that you might not normally think about. So, this document will try to give you some advice about how to best use \$HOMENAME as a buyer. If you're a seller, you might want to read our <a href="\${HTMLPATH}tips-sell.html">Tips for Sellers</a>. These tips come from user feedback after running millions of auctions here at \$HOMENAME.

<dt><strong>Bid only once!</strong>
<dd>This may seem strange at first, but it is in fact the best way to be sure you are not outbid. Remember that \$HOMENAME uses a proxy bidding system, which means that \$HOMENAME keeps your maximum bid secret. When you specify your maximum bid, \$HOMENAME records that amount, but bids only enough to outbid the previous high bidder. If someone outbids your current bid, \$HOMENAME immediately increases your bid only enough to outbid the new bid.
<p>
This continues until someone exceeds your maximum bid. The best reason to use this method of bidding is that you'll never be outbid at the last minute by someone, and not have enough time to place a new bid before the auction ends. If your preset maximum is outbid by someone, you probably didn't want to spend the money anyway, so you won't suffer the disappointment of having the auction close before you can get back to increase your bid.
 (See an <a
href=\${HTMLPATH}proxy-bidding.html>example</a>). 
<p>

<dt><strong>Ask your questions before you bid.</strong>
<dd>Remember, \$HOMENAME items are offered for sale by individuals, and everyone has different ways to present their items. If you have any questions about the item, make sure you get answers from the seller before placing your bid. You don't want to bid until you know for sure that you want the item, because you won't be able to take back your bid if you change your mind.
<p>

<dt><strong>Be courteous to other users</strong>
<dd>A little bit of courtesy goes a long way, especially via e-mail. Simply taking the time to write in complete sentences, with a salutation and closing, can make a big difference in how you come across via e-mail. Be sure to treat everyone with the courtesy that you expect to receive.
<p>

<dt><strong>Make note of the auction closing time</strong>
<dd>If you return to the site of the item right after closing, you'll see the official results. The e-mail notice about the end of the auction is not sent until the following morning, so you don't have to wait if you return to the item's page. That way, you can contact the seller right away to begin completing the transaction.
<p>

<dt><strong>See the sellers reputation</strong>
<dd>If you see a number in parentheses next to the seller's e-mail address, that number is the <strong>feedback rating.</strong> This rating is a summary of the comments that other users have made about this user. You can click on that number to take you to the actual comments, so you can review them to see what people are saying about that person.
<p>
It's a good idea to get an idea about the person behind the e-mail address, especially before you send money.
<p>

<dt><strong>Talk on the phone</strong>
<dd>If you wind up the high bidder in an auction, be sure you actually take the time to talk on the phone with the seller, especially if you have any discomfort about your e-mail exchanges with him/her. E-mail communication is a bit strange, and it is hard to get a good read on the other person's personality, honesty, etc., without having an actual conversation person-to-person.
<p>

Also, many people don't read their e-mail every day, so you shouldn't assume someone is ignoring you just because you haven't heard from them in a while. Pick up the phone and give a call. A $1.00 long distance call will pay for itself many times over by avoiding misunderstandings.
