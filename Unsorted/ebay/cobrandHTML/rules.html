eBay Auction Rules</H2>
Any use of the eBay site is governed by the following Auction Rules and
Disclaimer. If you haven't already, you may wish to read our <A HREF="welcome.html">Welcome
message</A> to get a feel for what we are trying to accomplish here.
<H3>
Auctions</H3>
Auctions typically last <B>3 - 7</B> days from the placement of the ad,
based on the duration the seller selects at the time the ad is placed.
eBay automatically terminates bidding at the end of the auction,
and notifies the seller and the high-bidder via e-mail.

<P>At the end of the auction, the owner and the high-bidder are notified
via e-mail. Auction results are also available for everyone to examine.
These results indicate the final bid price and the owner's and high-bidder's
e-mail addresses. The complete bidding history is also available as a link
from the description page. Buyer and seller should try to contact each
other within three business days of the end of the auction. Buyers run
the risk of losing their place as winning bidder if the seller contacts
the next bidder after three business days have elapsed.

<P>eBay acts solely as listing-agent. We don't get involved in the
actual transaction.
<H3>
Bidding</H3>
All bidding is done&nbsp; with bid increments, which vary from item to
item based on the current price.

<P>To place a bid, simply select the item from the main list, and then
press the bid button. Please bid the <B>maximum</B> amount you are willing
to pay for the item. <B>This amount is kept secret!</B> Bids will be made
on your behalf as necessary as other bidders increase the bid price. (You
will never bid more than your maximum, or more than the necessary preset
bid increment to outbid other bidders.) (See an <A HREF="proxy-bidding.html">example</A>).
This process is <B>different</B> for <A HREF="#dutch">Dutch Auctions</A>.

<P>In the case of a tie for high bid, the <B>earlier</B> bid will take
precedence.

<P>Once you make and confirm a bid, you cannot take it back, except under
dire circumstances. Bid retraction is a privilege that must not be abused.
Valid reasons for bid retraction do <B>not</B> include bidding or winning
a bid on another (perhaps similar) item; not having budget to pay for an
item; changing your mind; etc.

<P><B>Please bid carefully!</B>

<P>By placing a bid, you signify your <B>intention and ability</B> to buy
the item at any price up through your maximum bid amount. Placing a fraudulent
bid is not permitted, and may be legally actionable. We record enough information
to track the computer which originated the fraudulent bid and will file
complaints with the appropriate authorities when necessary.

<P><B>Important:</B> individuals who bid on an item and then back out of
the purchase for reasons other than legitimate concerns may be barred from
future use of the system, at our sole discretion. You are required to provide
a valid e-mail address with your bid.

<P>You will automatically receive notification if your maximum bid is outbid
by another bidder. But you should realize that you may be outbid minutes
before the close of an auction, and not have the opportunity to place a
new bid. Because of that, you are encouraged to bid your maximum bid at
the very start, and not worry about being outbid.
<H3>
Starting your own auction</H3>
It's fun and easy to start your own auction. Simply fill out the form available
at our home page to add an item. We ask that you use a short, descriptive
title, and a complete description. You may not use HTML tags in the title,
but you are free to do so in the description. This means that you can link
to pictures, etc., if you so choose.

<P>&nbsp;It's a good idea to set the minimum bid for your item a little
lower than you would think, just to get the auction going. If your minimum
bid is too high, people may not bid. However, keep in mind that the minimum
price you specify indicates the minimum amount you will accept to sell
the item.

<P>The software automatically specifies the bidding increment, based on
the current price. The increment is kept as low as possible to encourage
more people to bid.

<P>By placing an item on auction, you signify your <B>intention and ability</B>
to sell that item. Although no one can force you to sell your belongings
at the final auction price, not doing so may be legally actionable by the
high bidder.

<P>You may place any merchandise that you have the right to sell up for
auction. If we don't think your item is appropriate for any reason, we
reserve the right to move the item from one category to another or to end
the auction.

<P>All items will be charged a non-refundable insertion fee, and a listing
fee based on the final selling price if the item sells. Please see our
<A HREF="account.html">account information page</A>
for more information.

<P>Important: sellers are held to a slightly higher standard than bidders,
with regards to handling complaints made by potential buyers. If a seller
receives three or more legitimate complaints, the seller may be barred
from using this service, at our sole discretion. You are required to provide
a valid e-mail address with your listing.

<P>In addition, sellers who submit illicit or illegal items may be barred
from future use of the system, at our sole discretion.

<P>You can advertise the existence of your auction with the URL:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=ITEMNUMBER</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT>ITEM NUMBER</TT> is the item number assigned to your item.
<H3>
<A NAME="manip"></A>Price manipulation</H3>
Sellers are prohibited from manipulating the price of any item they are
selling, either by use of a shill (a secondary account or third party)
or by bidding themselves. Sellers who shill bid on items may be barred
from future use of the system, at our sole discretion.

<P>Some rules for sellers are listed below:

<P>First, a seller should set the minimum bid for their auction to the
lowest fair price at which they are willing to sell their item. This is
the preferred mechanism, since it seems to be the most fair option for
all involved.

<P>Second, a seller may employ a <A HREF="#reserve">Reserve Price Auction.</A>
This allows the seller to set a price below which he/she does not agree
to sell the item.

<P>Third, a seller in a non-reserve price auction may bid on his/her own
item only <B>once.</B> This may happen if a seller starts an auction at
a particular price, and then realizes that he/she wants to keep the item
at a price above that minimum bid. This restriction applies to sellers'
agents or associates as well. Keep in mind that we keep all bidding records
and can track multiple bids, and that the bidding history is visible to
anyone who is interested.
<H3>
<A NAME="reserve"></A>Reserve Prices</H3>
Some auctions may be run with <I>reserve prices.</I> The reserve price
is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell an item. The reserve
price is never disclosed to bidders. A seller might specify a reserve price
if he/she is unsure of the real value of his/her item and would like to
reserve the right to refuse to sell the item if the market value is below
a certain price. During an auction, an annotation will be displayed in
the item information screen if the seller has specified a reserve price.

<P>The seller specifies the reserve price when he/she lists an item. This
price should be above the minimum bid price. The auction begins at the
minimum bid price. When a bidder's maximum bid is equal to or greater than
the reserve price, the item's current price is raised to the reserve price.
At this time, the item information will indicate the reserve price has
been met. The bidder is also notified that his/her bid met the reserve.

<P>Please note, reserve price auctions are not available for Dutch auctions
and reserve auctions are not eligible for display in the Hot Items section.
<H3>
<A NAME="min"></A>Minimum bid</H3>
Keep in mind that the minimum bid specified by the seller indicates the
minimum amount the seller will accept to sell the item, unless the seller
are using a <A HREF="#reserve">reserve price</A>. Refusing to sell an item
once someone has placed a bid that reaches the seller's minimum or reserve
price is a violation of the Auction Rules.
<H3>
Adult Information</H3>
Please see our document on <A HREF="adult.html">adults-only</A>
merchandise at eBay.
<H3>
<A NAME="private"></A>Private auctions</H3>
A seller may specify that an auction will be a private auction. This means
bidders' e-mail addresses will never be disclosed on the item screen or
bidding history screen. Only the seller and the high-bidder will be notified
via e-mail when the auction is over.

<P>This option is useful when the seller realizes that potential bidders
may not want their identities disclosed to the general public.

<P>This option is not available for Dutch auctions.
<H3>
<A NAME="dutch"></A>Dutch auctions</H3>
Dutch auctions are a special auction format to handle the case where a
seller has multiple identical items he/she wishes to sell. The seller specifies
the minimum price (the starting bid) and the number of items available.
Bidders bid a particular amount at or above that minimum for a particular
quantity they are interested in purchasing. At the close of the auction,
the highest bidders earn the right to purchase the items at the <B>lowest</B>
successful bid.

<P>For example, let's assume there are ten TVs being sold at $100. Twenty
five people bid for one TV each, at $100. In this case, only the <B>first</B>
ten people will be the successful bidders, since the bid amounts are the
same, and earlier bids take precedence.

<P>Now, let's say that one of those people bid $150 for one TV. Since her
bid is higher than all the others, she will certainly be one of the successful
bidders. The other nine TVs will be claimed by the earliest bidders who
bid $100, so the final price for each TV will be $100.

<P>If enough people bid above the minimum bid, the final price of the item
will increase as well. On the other hand, if less than ten people bid in
our example TV auction, then only that number of TVs will be sold at the
opening price of $100. For the selling price to increase past the opening
price specified by the seller, there must be an equal or higher level of
demand than the supply indicated. In our example, the selling price would
only increase if eleven or more TVs were bid upon, no matter what the amount
of each bid.

<P>In the case of multiple quantities bid for by a bidder, the lowest bidder
may not earn the right to purchase the complete quantity, since there may
only be one left by the time the higher bidders have been processed. In
other words, if the lowest bidder requested a quantity of three TVs, she
may only be entitled to one TV, since there are nine other TVs allocated
to higher bidders. The only way around this problem is to ensure that you
are not the lowest bidder. In some cases, a bidder may reserve the right
to refuse purchase of a partial quantity. In that case, the seller may
skip that bidder and move on to the next one, if any.

<P>In Dutch auctions, the current standings are always displayed after
the item description, and the complete bidding history (including unsuccessful
bids) is available as usual.
