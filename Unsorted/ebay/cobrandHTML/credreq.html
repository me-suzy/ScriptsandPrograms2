<h2>Listing fee credit request</h2>

You may request a credit for any listing fee due for an item which you are subsequently unable to sell. This credit is intended to go towards a new listing at \$HOMENAME. Each time you place a listing you receive value from the service we provide even if your sale unfortunately falls through.
<p>

Before requesting a credit, be sure all the following is true:
<ul>
<li>If you haven't heard from a bidder, at least 14 days have elapsed since the end of the auction (to give everyone time to respond)
<li><strong>No more than 45 days have elapsed since the end of the auction</strong>
<li>&quot;Non-refundable&quot; <b>insertion fees</b> you pay to start the auction are not refundable
</ul>

This form documents the fact that you have made a good faith effort to complete the sale of your item with the potential buyers that \$HOMENAME has provided you. <p>

Please print this form out and complete all the information requested. Unfortunately, e-mail still does not enjoy the same legal status as written communication, so credit requests must be made in writing.<p>

Credit requests must be received before <strong>45 days</strong> have elapsed since the end of the auction, so that we can verify the information. Requests received after that time must unfortunately be declined. <p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
For each item for which you are requesting a credit, please specify the dollar amount you actually received or anticipate receiving from the bidders with whom you were able to complete a sale. Please print all information clearly.
