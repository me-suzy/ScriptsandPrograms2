 <hr>
<p>All reported suspect behavior is examined on a case by case basis,
because they are all so very different. We attempt to resolve accusations
as quickly as possible based on all the information at our disposal. If we
are unsure, no action is taken. Please remember that we are investigating
multiple cases simultaneously; some take only 15-20 minutes, while others
may require many days of focused effort to extract the necessary
information and look for patterns.<p>

<p>Some cases are blatant and obvious and require little work. Others are
very tedious and well hidden. We will typically ATTEMPT to contact you with
results of the investigation.  However, please understand that for legal
reasons we cannot always discuss details of the result of the
investigation.  In most of these cases,  we have already taken disciplinary
action.</p><br>

<p>Finally, should you not agree with our final assessment and action (or
inaction) regarding a given investigation, please remember that we have to
approach each case with a balanced and hopefully objective viewpoint. We
must be fair to everyone involved. Repeated inquiries regarding the outcome
of the investigation will only hinder this process.</p>

To report possible misuse, e-mail <A HREF="mailto:support@ebay.com">safeharbor@ebay.com</A>
<br><br>
Please note that if your e-mail does not meet one of the investigation criteria set above,
 it will be redirected to <A HREF="mailto:support@ebay.com">support@ebay.com </A>.
This may result in a significant delay in response!
