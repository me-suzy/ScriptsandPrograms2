<h2>About eBay accounts</h2>

<strong>New users:</strong> Please read our policy on <a href=\${HTMLPATH}credapp.html>credit approval,</a> which is effective immediately.
<p>

To make your payment more convenient, create your eBay account! You may also change your current
credit card information using this form. For your convenience, here is a review of our affordable fees:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A low insertion fee applies to all new listings.
<li>Items receiving no bids have no additional charge.
<li>For reserve price auctions, items receiving no bids at or above the reserve
price have no additional charge.
</ul>

Other items will be billed a percentage based on the closing value of the auction. For simple auctions, this is the closing bid. For Dutch auctions, this is the lowest successful bid times the total quantity sold. The billing rate is:
<ul>
<li>5.0% for amount up to $25,
<li>2.5% the balance up to $1,000, and
<li>1.25% for the remaining balance.
</ul>
This nominal charge will be billed on a monthly basis to account holders, so you don't have to worry about tracking multiple small charges.
<p>

<h4>Insertion fees</h4>
The insertion fee for all new items, is based upon the opening value of the auction item. For simple auctions, this is the higher of the minimum bid and the reserve price (if any). For Dutch auctions, this is the minimum bid times the quantity offered. Reserve price auctions are billed based on the reserve price, not the minimum bid.
<ul>
<li>Opening value $0.01 - $9.99:   <strong>$0.25</strong>
<li>Opening value $10.00 - $24.99: <strong>$0.50</strong>
<li>Opening value $25.00 - $49.99: <strong>$1.00</strong>
<li>Opening value $50.00 and up:   <strong>$2.00</strong>
</ul>

This fee is non-refundable and is due even if the item does not sell.
<p>

Placing a listing indicates seller's agreement to pay this non-refundable fee. Fees are invoiced monthly according to the same schedule and policies that are in place for eBay accounts. You can review the <a href=\${HTMLPATH}billing.html>eBay Billing Information</a> document by following the preceding link.

<h3>Why open an account?</h3>

For most convenient payment, we encourage you to open a credit card
account with us. By doing so, you give us your VISA or MasterCard information,
and we will automatically invoice and bill you monthly for any fees due. New users wishing
to receive <a href=\${HTMLPATH}credapp.html>credit approval</a> may also do so with a VISA or MasterCard.
<p>

If you prefer, you can choose to pay our invoices by mail or by fax when you receive
them once per month, but you are responsible for paying on time, or late fees will apply. Also,
since e-mail can be unreliable, you are still responsible for paying on time, even if you do
not receive the e-mail invoice. To avoid late fees, please consider using your VISA or MasterCard.
<p>

Please review our <a href=\${HTMLPATH}billing.html>eBay Billing Policies</a>.
