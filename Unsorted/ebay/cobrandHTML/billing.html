<h2>\$HOMENAME Billing Information</h2>

This document describes our billing policies. For complete information about listing
fees, you can review the terms and conditions listed in our <a href=\${HTMLPATH}account-order.html>account-creation form</a>.
<p>

Any auction listing which terminates meeting the conditions described in
that document will be billed a listing fee.
<p>

<h3>\$HOMENAME accounts</h3>
You are encouraged to open an <a href=\${HTMLPATH}account.html>\$HOMENAME account</a>. This
simplifies our billing process and ensures your payment is never late. And, you
don't have to deal with preparing and mailing your payment each month.
<p>

If your account was established prior to February 1997, please review the
following payment terms for settling your account. <strong>New
users:</strong> Please read our policy on <a href=\${HTMLPATH}credapp.html>credit
approval,</a> which is effective immediately.

<h3>Payment terms</h3>

Fees are <strong>not</strong> due immediately upon the close of
your auctions. Rather, your account becomes due and payable at the end
of the month. E-mail invoices are sent on the <strong>first of the
month.</strong> This saves you the trouble of having to make multiple payments
during the month if you list multiple items.
<p>

\$HOMENAME account holders can keep the invoice for their records, and their
credit cards will be billed automatically.
<p>

Non-account holders must pay the invoice <strong>before</strong> the first
day of the following month. For simplicity, this is referred to as <strong>
Net 30</strong> payment terms.

<p>
<strong>NOTE: It is your responsibility to pay any amount due, whether
or not you receive the e-mail invoice.</strong> Remember, you can always
check the balance due on your account from our <a
href=\${HTMLPATH}account-status.html>account status</a> form.

<p>

<h3>Payment options</h3>

\$HOMENAME accounts require VISA or MasterCard, but payments made by
mail or fax may be made with a check or money order. Please add $10 for
any foreign check or money order.

<h3>The fine print</h3>
Checks or money orders drawn on foreign banks must include an additional
US$10.00 to cover bank fees. Returned checks subject to $15.00 service charge.
Past due accounts are billed 1.5% monthly finance charge, minimum $0.50. Past
due accounts subject to termination and $5.00 reactivation fee. We reserve the
right to recover costs of collection. Fees and policies are subject to change
without notice.
<p>
<h3><a name=creditbal>About credit balances</a></h3>

From time to time, your \$HOMENAME account may contain a credit balance (money we owe you). We will gladly issue a refund check for any credit balance over $1.00, upon written request to our corporate office. See our <a href=\${HTMLPATH}contact.html>contact page</a> for the address.
