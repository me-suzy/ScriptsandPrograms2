	<TD WIDTH=590 COLSPAN=10><P>Dear eBay Community, </P><P>Some of you have had questions regarding two very important topics recently: Advertising and Cookies. I wanted to take this opportunity to address each topic and to answer your questions. </P><P><B>Advertising</B> - As you may know, the large majority of Internet services today use advertising to keep the cost of services down. Advertising revenue helps us continue to grow and expand our services while keeping your costs to a minimum. Advertising also helps expand eBay's exposure on other Internet sites, which helps attract more buyers and sellers to the auctions here on eBay.</P><P>We have experimented with advertising in the past, with varying degrees of success. We plan to reintroduce advertising and sponsorships in way that will bring value to you and that will keep your costs down at eBay. </FONT></P><P>Advertisers often measure the success of their campaigns by counting the number of people that actually click on a banner. From our past experience with advertising, we have learned that people don't like irrelevant ads or ads that distract them from their eBay activities. So, in the future, we hope to introduce advertisers that offer products or services which appeal directly to your areas of interest or that help support your buying and selling on eBay. </P><P>We will never sell your e-mail address to an advertisers. We are opposed to the use of unsolicited commercial e-mail (&quot;UCE&quot; or &quot;spam&quot;). As an eBay user, you will be free to pay attention to or ignore any ads or sponsors you see on the eBay site. And you will be free to use eBay without fear of being directly targeted by junk e-mail. </P><P><B>Cookies -</B> Cookies are used by Internet services to store information about your use 
of their service on your own computer where it can only be retrieved by the same service at a later date. </P><P>For example, I use a site called movielink.com, which gives you movie times at nearby theaters. The first time I visited the site, I typed in my zip code to let them know where I was. Now, when I log onto the site, the site automatically knows that I am in the San Jose area because it reads the zip code from the cookie stored on my computer. That saves me from having to login multiple times and from having to enter my interests multiple times. That saves me time. </P><P>It is sometimes strange to me to hear the notion that cookies somehow invade my privacy. In many ways, a cookie provides an added level of privacy. By storing information on my own computer rather than the Internet servers, I can examine the data files and see exactly which information is being recorded by the Internet service using cookies. I can also delete the cookie files, and the information is never recorded on anyone else's computer at all. Right now, eBay does not use cookies. However, we would like to use cookies in the future. As we begin to offer more personalized services, cookies could be used to save you the trouble of having to log in every time you visit. We are also planning to support users that would prefer to log in each time, in case they are using shared computers. Our advertisers may also want to use cookies, if only to try to avoid showing you the same ad over and over again. </P><P>Cookies can be used by Internet services to make their services much more convenient and personalized, and I would hate to be denied that benefit by concerns over their misuse. The Internet sites that use cookies do so responsibly, and I've never heard of a case otherwise. At eBay, we will continue tell you exactly what we plan to do with cookies and how they will be used to improve our service to you. And we enco
urage you to make up your own mind about cookies. </P><P>If you would like more information about cookies, you may wish to do a search on Yahoo or visit <A HREF="http://www.cookiecentral.com">www.cookiecentral.com</U></A>. </P><P>As eBay continues to grow as a Top Ten commerce-related site on the Internet, these issues are becoming more important. We are committed to keeping the needs of our community at the forefront of the decisions we make.<P>Regards, </P><P>Pierre</TD>
