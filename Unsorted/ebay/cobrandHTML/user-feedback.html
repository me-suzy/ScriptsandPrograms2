  <p><strong>If you regret a comment you made. </strong><br>
  If you have previously left a negative comment and have since been able to resolve your
  misunderstanding, we encourage you to leave a positive or neutral Feedback comment for
  that person and explain that the misunderstanding has been resolved. </p>
  <p><strong>Resolving disputes by e-mail or by telephone.</strong><br>
  eBay cannot remove a comment once it is submitted, nor edit a user's Feedback Profile. For
  this reason, we encourage you to contact your trading partner directly by e-mail or by
  telephone <i>before</i> leaving a negative Feedback comment. Usually, a misunderstanding
  or dispute can be resolved by telephone. You can request another person's contact
  information by clicking <a href="http://www.ebay.com/aw/user-query.html">here</a>.</p>
