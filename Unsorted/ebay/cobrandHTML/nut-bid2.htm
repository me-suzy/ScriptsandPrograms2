Browsing the Listings</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To get to the listings pages, click on &quot;Listings&quot; at the top
or bottom of any eBay page, or click on the name of a category on the \$HOMENAME homepage. The listings at eBay are divided into categories and
sub-categories. Let's take a look at a sample Listings Page for the category,
&quot;Computers : Hardware.&quot;</font></p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="3" width="590">
  <tr>
    <td width="396" valign="top"><img src="nut-browsepage1.gif" width="396" height="753"
    alt="nut-browsepage1.gif (70771 bytes)"></td>
    <td width="194" valign="top"><font size="2"><strong>Listings Pages are composed of 4 main
    sections.</strong></font><p><font size="2"><strong>1. Categories.</strong><br>
    Here we can specify sub-categories that we are interested in. Clicking on a sub-category
    focuses the listings so that only items that are related to a particular sub-category will
    be shown.<br><br>You can also restrict the listings to show only items that are <font color="blue">New Today</font> 
	(posted in the last 24 hours), <font color="blue">Ending Today</font> (ending in the next 24 hours), <font color="blue">Completed</font> 
	(already ended), or <font color="blue">Going, Going, Gone</font> (ending in the next 3 hours).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>2. Featured Auctions.</strong><br>
    These are auctions that have been featured by eBay sellers. It costs extra to have your
    auction appear in this section.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>3. Hot Items.</strong><br>
    Hot items are those that have already received more than 30 bids.</font>
	<img height=11 width=28 alt="[HOT!]" src="\${IMAGEPAGE}/hot.gif"></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>4. All Items.</strong><br>
    The entire list of items in the specified category (Computers : Hardware in this example), 
    is shown here. Often, there are several pages of listings. In
    this example, there are 69 pages, and we are currently on the first page. Clicking on an item title
	will show you the detailed description of that item, and allow you to place a bid on that item.<br><br>
	Some items have a<img height=11 width=28 alt="[PIC!]" src="\${IMAGEPAGE}pic.gif">
	icon next to their titles, meaning that the item description includes 
	a picture of the item.<br><br>Items that have been posted in the last 24 hours are marked 
	with a <img height=11 width=28 alt="[NEW!]" src="\${IMAGEPAGE}new.gif"> icon.</font></p>

look at the next screen, which will teach you the other way of finding stuff--using the
search facility. </font></p>
