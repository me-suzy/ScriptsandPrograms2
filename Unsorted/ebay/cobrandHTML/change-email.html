<h2>Changing your e-mail address</h2>

eBay's \$HOMENAME keeps track of you based on your e-mail address. You always enter your e-mail address when listing an item for sale or bidding, for example. And, if you are a seller, your e-mail address is effectively your account number.
<p>

When you change e-mail addresses, \$HOMENAME thinks you are an entirely new user. You have to register again with us, and you will receive separate invoices for each e-mail account you register with us. Please keep in mind that we encourage people to use only a single e-mail address with \$HOMENAME.

<h3>How to begin using a new e-mail address with \$HOMENAME</h3>

Please follow these simple steps to begin using a new e-mail address with \$FULLNAME:
<ol>
<li><a href=\${HTMLPATH}register.html>Register</a> your new e-mail address, just like you did your old one.
<li>Wait for the e-mail information on confirming your registration. This should normally take just a few minutes.
<li><a href=\${HTMLPATH}reg-confirm.html>Confirm</a> your new registration, and choose a custom password, if you like.
<li>Once your new e-mail has been confirmed, return to this form and complete the information requested.
</ol>

<h3>Linking your feedback</h3>

The primary purpose of completing this form is to link your feedback for your new e-mail account into your old, existing feedback file. If you have no existing feedback file, you should still complete this form so we can make a note of your new e-mail address.
