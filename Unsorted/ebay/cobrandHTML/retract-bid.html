<h2>Retracting bids you have placed in an \$HOMENAME auction</h2>

You may use this form to retract bids you have made in an auction <strong>if</strong> you have a valid reason. Since all \$HOMENAME bids are <strong>binding</strong>, you should only retract bids you have the legitimate right to retract. Here are a few examples of a legitimate retraction:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Seller has substantively changed the description of the item after you bid.
<li>You made a clear error in the amount of your bid. Caution: bidding a little too high is not a &quot;clear error&quot;. For example, you bid $99.50 instead of $9.95.
</ul>

<p>

Users who abuse this mechanism by retracting bids because they changed their minds, or because they decided they could no longer afford the item, will receive negative feedback from the sellers of those items. Too much negative feedback may cause you to be barred from future auctions.

<p>

Retraction will eliminate <strong>all</strong> bids you have placed in this auction. If you are trying to correct an error in a bid, you will have to bid again. And please bid carefully.

<h3>Explanation</h3>

Your retraction will be publicized in the bidding history for this auction, and you may be asked to explain your retraction to the seller or other bidders. If the retraction was not legitimate, you open yourself to potential negative feedback from other users.
<p>

For this reason, please include a concise (no more than one line) explanation of your retraction for inclusion in the official record.
<p>

For your protection, you need a password in order to retract a bid. If you haven't selected a personal password, or if you've forgotten your password, please <a href=\${HTMLPATH}reqpass.html>request a new temporary password</a> before proceeding.
