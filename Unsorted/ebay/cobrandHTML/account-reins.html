<h3>Terms &  Conditions</h3>
<strong>Please read before continuing:</strong>
<p>
You will be billed monthly for any listings you have placed in
the previous month as described below:

<ul>
<li>A low insertion fee applies to all new listings.
<li>Items receiving no bids have no additional charge.
<li>For reserve price auctions, items receiving no bids at or above the reserve
price have no additional charge.
</ul>
<p>

Other items will be billed a percentage based on the closing value of the auction. For simple auctions, this is the closing bid. For Dutch auctions, this is the lowest successful bid times the total quantity sold. The billing rate is:
<ul>
<li>5.0% for amount up to $25.
<li>2.5% for the balance up to $1,000.00.
<li>1.25% for the remaining balance.
</ul>
This nominal charge will be billed on a monthly basis to account holders, so you don't have to worry about tracking multiple small charges. In addition, the insertion fee for items subject to a listing fee will be credited. In other words, if you sell your item and have to pay a listing fee, your account will be credited for the insertion fee that was charged. That means you can go ahead and insert another item with no additional fee!
<p>

<h4>Insertion fees</h4>
The insertion fee for all new items, is based upon the opening value of the auction item. For simple auctions, this is the higher of the minimum bid and the reserve price (if any). For Dutch auctions, this is the minimum bid times the quantity offered.
<ul>
<li>Opening value $0.01 - $9.99:   <strong>$0.25</strong>
<li>Opening value $10.00 - $24.99: <strong>$0.50</strong>
<li>Opening value $25.00 - $49.99: <strong>$1.00</strong>
<li>Opening value $50.00 and up:   <strong>$2.00</strong>
</ul>

This fee is non-refundable but is credited against the listing fee which becomes due on items which sell. If an item does not sell, the fee is non-refundable.
<p>

Fees are due
regardless of how the auction was closed; i.e., if the seller decided to end
the auction before the normal ending date, the fee is still due. The fee is due immediately upon the
end of the auction, and is not contingent on seller consummating the sale with
the buyer. Remember, the listing fee covers the cost of providing the listing
service, not delivering a buyer. You may request credit towards future activity if a sale cannot be completed. Seller's credit card will be billed monthly for all listing fees
due and payable in the prior month. This account will exist until we receive
explicit instructions to remove it. There is no monthly minimum fee. Fees and service offerings subject to change without notice.
<p>

<strong>In addition, I authorize a $5.00 processing fee to reinstate my account.</strong>
