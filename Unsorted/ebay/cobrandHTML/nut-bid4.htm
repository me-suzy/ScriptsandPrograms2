Make a bid!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now we are ready to place a bid.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Remember, bidding is the same as buying or entering into a contract with
the seller. However, to make this tutorial easy to read and understand, we have removed
some of the legal wording.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After you have searched for and found an item, or browsed through the
listings and clicked on an item, you are ready to bid. It does not cost any money 
to bid on items at eBay. Of course, if you win the auction, you must pay the seller directly, but 
you will not be charged anything by eBay.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this case, we have a sample bid screen for an item. Since sellers can
list their items any way they want, many of the screens you will see will look quite
different.</font></p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="3" width="590">
  <tr>
    <td width="396" valign="top"><img src="nut-bidding1.gif" width="396" height="810"

    <td width="194" valign="top"><font size="2"><strong>Bidding pages are composed of 3 main
    sections</strong></font><p><font size="2"><strong>1. Auction details.</strong><br>
    This tells you all the details about the auction, such as the ending time and who the
    seller is.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>2. Item description.</strong><br>
    This is the description that the seller wrote about the item he/she is selling. It often
    includes a picture of the item.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>3. Bidding form.</strong><br>
    This is where you bid.</font></p>

    <p><strong><font size="2">Bidding is easy.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the maximum you are willing to pay for
    the item. (Your maximum amount will be kept <b>secret;</b> eBay will bid on your behalf as
    necessary by increasing your bid by the current bid&nbsp; increment up until your maximum
    is reached. This saves you the trouble of having to keep track of the auction as it
    proceeds and prevents you from being outbid at the last minute unless your spending limit
    is exceeded. See a <a
	href="proxy-bidding.html">proxy bidding example</a>.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter your email address and password.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><strong>Step 3.</strong> Hit the &quot;review bid&quot; button.</font></td>
  </tr>

<p><font size="3">Once you press the &quot;review bid&quot; button, you'll receive a
confirmation. Let's move on to the next screen to see what the Bid Confirmation looks
like.</font></p>
