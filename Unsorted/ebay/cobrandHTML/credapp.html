<h2>\$HOMENAME Credit Approval</h2>

In order to keep our rates as low as possible, we instituted a credit approval process, effective February 1997. New users will be able to make moderate use of the system prior to credit approval, but will require approval before making more extensive use of the system.
<p>

<h3><a name=new>New users</a></h3>

New users are invited to make moderate use of \$HOMENAME without waiting for credit approval. At the present time, new users may incur up to $10.00 in usage fees prior to requiring credit approval. Feel free to start using the system right away, while you wait for us to approve your good credit!
<p>

<h4>What is required for credit approval?</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href=#visa>A valid VISA or MasterCard credit card,</a> or
<li><a href=#deposit>A deposit of $10.00 or more via check or money order</a>
</ul>

Of course, you must also be a <a href=\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterShow>registered user.</a>
<p>

<h4><a name=visa>Credit approval with a VISA or MasterCard</a></h4>

To use your VISA or MasterCard to establish credit, please
<ul>
<li>follow our <a href=\${HTMLPATH}account.html>\$HOMENAME account creation process.</a>
</ul>
This can be done online if you have a secure browser, or via fax or postal mail. A <b>$10.00</b> charge will be applied right away, and credited to your account. This helps us verify that your credit card was recorded properly. <b>This is not a registration fee,</b> since the charge is credited to your \$HOMENAME account immediately. (See <a href=#creditbal>below</a> for information on credit balances.)
<p>

Using a credit card saves you the trouble of making an advance deposit each time you want to use the system.
<p>

<h4><a name=deposit>Credit approval with a deposit</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Be sure you are already a <a href=\${CGIPATH}eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterShow>registered user.</a>
<li>Then, send your check or money order for any amount of at least $10.00, along with this <a href=\${HTMLPATH}pay-coupon.html>payment coupon.</a>
<li>Always write your \$LOGINPROMPT on your check!
</ul>
<p>

Your deposit will be credited to your account as soon as your payment clears, usually within five business days. You will then be able to incur charges until your deposit is exhausted. At that time, you will have to make another deposit.
<p>

<h4><a name=creditbal>About credit balances</a></h4>

From time to time, your \$HOMENAME account may contain a credit balance (money we owe you). We will gladly issue a refund check for any credit balance over $1.00, upon written request to our corporate office. See our <a href=\${HTMLPATH}contact.html>contact page</a> for the address.
