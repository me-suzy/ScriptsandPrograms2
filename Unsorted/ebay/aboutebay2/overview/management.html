						 A casual dinner conversation in 1995 between Pierre and his fianc&eacute;e changed the face of Internet commerce and began the development of one of the strongest online communities in the world. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 His fianc&eacute;e's passion for Pez&#153;, the colorful candy dispensers, and lack of trading partners in the San Francisco Bay Area sparked Pierre to find a solution&#151;an online auction, now called eBay, was the answer. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 Pierre has a history of success with some of the most visionary companies in the Silicon Valley and has established a personal reputation among the Valley's tech elite. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 A co-founder of Ink Development Corp. in 1991, Pierre was instrumental in leading the firm into the uncharted waters of Internet shopping in 1993. The company, then renamed eShop, was subsequently purchased by Microsoft in early 1996. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 With an acute vision of the demand for consumer trading via the Internet, Pierre initially developed eBay as an experiment to assess demand for this type of trade. When all expectations were exceeded, he resigned from his full-time position in Developer Relations for General Magic to further develop the eBay service. While at General Magic, Pierre developed the first Web application for Magic Cap and contributed to other significant Internet projects. 
						</P>
