						<H3>1998 Grant Recipients</H3>

						<P>Our first two grant recipients exemplify the eBay FoundationÂ’s principles. These programs provide long-term and far-reaching benefits for the program participants and others in their community.

						<P><B>Friends of Farm Drive</B>
						<BR> Friends of Farm Drive is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for the residents of a San Jose, California neighborhood. The area is rampant with drug dealing and gang activity and is well known to local law enforcement agencies. 

						<P>Friends of Farm Drive is spearheaded by a member of a neighborhood church. The organization has partnered with agencies such as the California Youth Authority, San Jose Police Department, San Jose State University, and numerous medical staff, in helping to create a safe haven for the community. Friends of Farm Drive currently rents two apartments in the neighborhood, which are used as community centers. Volunteers assist with homework, teach English as a Second Language (ESL), arrange monthly food donations, staff injection clinics, and administer tuberculosis testing and treatment. 

						<P>The eBay Foundation grant will help the Friends of Farm Drive fund a summer program by providing salaries for members of the Youth Outreach Program, who will administer a recreation program targeted at "high-risk" youth, ages 14 through 20. The grant will also assist Friends of Farm Drive in establishing a computer learning center. Volunteers will offer technical instruction to adults and youth, enabling them to develop computer skills. The program is currently run entirely by volunteers. 

						<P><B>University Research Expedition Program (UREP)</B>
						<BR> The mission of the <A HREF="http://urep.ucdavis.edu">University Research Expeditions Program</A> is to "improve our understanding of life on earth through partnership between University of California UC researchers and members of the general public." Established in 1976, UREP has supported thousands of research teams and provided opportunities for students, teachers, and other members of the public to join UC scientists on research projects investigating critical issues of environmental, human, and economic importance worldwide. 

						<P>The eBay Foundation grant will provide scholarships to send California elementary and high school teachers on UREP trips, where they will learn by working side-by-side with university scientists and local residents in countries around the world. The teachers will have the opportunity to work with the local people in the countries they visit (for example, teaching the value of preserving local rainforests). Teachers will return from these research projects energized and excited to teach what they learned to their students. These programs increase awareness of current events and foster understanding of different cultures among both students and teachers. Additionally, the volunteer efforts make valuable research possible, which benefits everyone.
