						 eBay, the world's personal trading community, has changed the way people buy and sell collectibles and unique items. By providing a safe trading place on the Internet, the eBay community has flourished. Not only does eBay provide an efficient medium for people to buy or sell items directly from or to a large number of people, it's a forum where buyers and sellers develop reputations and, in some cases, it can change people's lives. In three years of providing online, person-to-person trading, more than 850,000 users have registered in the community. Here is what some of them have to say about eBay.

						 An avid collector and dealer of Hot Wheels and old toys, Jon discovered eBay in January 1998. Since that time, he has been doing 90 percent of his business on eBay and no longer attends out-of-state trade shows. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 &quot;I feel that eBay will become the way of the future. The problem with print ads and mailing lists for collectibles is that someone always beats you to the good items. Someone always calls first or sees the list first. On eBay, you just bid, and you decide how much you are willing to pay.&quot;

						 When his grandmother became ill, Kenyata quite his job in the music industry to care for her full time. Coming from a family of &quot;pack rats,&quot; they had attics full of items that needed only to find the right outlet to be valuable. He says, &quot;And then, as if on cue, I found eBay.&quot; 
						</P>
						<P>
						 He feels that offline he couldn't always find the right place to sell his items. &quot;But with eBay, I found an outlet for all of those delightful little curiosities! And at the same time, since the middleman was eliminated, I also found a way to keep my bank account afloat. eBay has allowed me to take care of my family, and become a successful businessman. It's allowed me to find truly unique items as gifts to better help me express to loved ones how I feel about them. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 eBay has given Kenyata the means to get back into the music industry, producing independent label CDs by unknown bands.

						 As a new mother of quadruplets, Wendy was looking for ways to bring in extra income without being away from her children. She now sells more than 25 items a week on eBay and is able to supplement the family income.

						 She says, &quot;eBay is a God send. eBay answered my prayers. My children don't even know I work.&quot;

						 Before discovering eBay, Michael operated an antique store in California. Now, by using eBay he has a larger income and customer base. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 &quot;I closed my store last year when I found I could gross the same amount with 1/12 the expense using eBay and trade shows ($30,000 and more a month). I can now sell my antiques nationally and not be tied to geographical preferences. For instance, Tiffany glass doesn't sell well on the West Coast because of earthquakes, but now I can reach buyers in the Midwest and on the East Coast. It is going to be the way people do business&quot;

						 As for how eBay has impacted his business, &quot;I never would have imagined how much growth I would have. The auction system has been crucial to my success.&quot;

						 Button Barb, as she's known on eBay, started collecting buttons about seven years ago after purchasing a jar of buttons at an estate auction. These buttons were originally destined for doll clothes, but the interesting selection of buttons inside the jar quickly turned Barbara into a button collector. She turned to the Internet for more information and then other collectors lead her to eBay to find quality antique buttons. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 One special auction highlights just how eBay connects people. &quot;This lady was bidding on one of my buttons, and after the auction closed she sent me her check, and I realized that I had been purchasing craft calendars from her for about 10 years at a crafts fair in Fredricksburg, Texas. When we realized that we know each other, she sent my refill calendar for $19.99 in exchange for the button she won on eBay.&quot;

						 Judy William's experience with eBay has allowed her to transition off welfare and increasingly on to self-sufficiency. By April 1997, Judy was a divorced, single mother on welfare - doing her best to keep her antique shop alive. When the welfare office advised Judy to go on disability, Judy said &quot;I know there's something I can do.&quot; 
						</P>
						<P>
						 A friend had told her about eBay. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 Armed with a credit card, Judy bought a computer and got online. Soon, she was selling items on eBay and earning a living. She called the welfare office to tell them that she didn't need food stamps anymore. She is considering closing the antique shop. 
						</P>
						<P>
						 &quot;I turned down the disability,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I wanted to make it.&quot;
