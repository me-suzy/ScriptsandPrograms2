							 Shopping for a Father's Day gift becomes more difficult after you have exhausted the traditional gift list - ties, socks and soap-on-a-rope. Many shoppers are turning to eBay (

							 As many eBay users have found, eBay truly has something for everyone. This is one big reason why men are spending more time on eBay. According to published RelevantKnowledge figures for February, men spend more time on eBay than any other site on the Internet. Shoppers can find sports memorabilia, movies, music, hobby items, books - and much more! If dad has a hobby or a particular interest, it's represented on eBay.

							 &quot;The X-Files community is alive and well on eBay,&quot; said Beverly Wolf, an avid X-phile who trades on eBay. &quot;There is X-Files memorabilia on the site that is truly unique. X-philes like myself have always been a huge force on the Internet - and are now a growing contingent within the eBay community.&quot;

							 The giant lizard causes terrorized Manhattan-ites to flee in the new movie &quot;Godzilla,&quot; but online he's creating a different stir. Delighted fans are flocking to eBay Inc., the world's personal trading community<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> (

							 Godzilla collectibles have become hot commodities-and eBay provides a unique and exciting way for movie fans and serious collectors to shop for them. Whether looking for posters from the current movie or for vintage toys, a simple search on eBay under &quot;Godzilla&quot; brings up hundreds of rare and hard-to-find items from around the world. eBay shoppers have much more to choose from than any store, mall or trade show could possibly offer!
