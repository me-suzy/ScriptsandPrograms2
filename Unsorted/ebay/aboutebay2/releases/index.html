				<H5>Three-Year Agreement Links Warner Bros. Web Sites with eBay</H5></FONT>
				
				<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>BURBANK and SAN JOSE, Calif. March 29, 1999</B> - Warner Bros. Online, the fastest-growing studio site on the Internet and a Time Warner Entertainment Company (NYSE: TWX, www.warnerbros.com), has forged a three-year strategic alliance with eBayÂ™ (NASDAQ: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's leading person-to-person online trading community.
				<P>This alliance integrates eBay throughout the Warner Bros. Online Entertainment sites, including the brand-centric personal home page community, AcmeCity, where fans can build their own sites using content from Warner Bros. properties.  AcmeCity is the recently announced joint venture between Warner Bros. Online and FortuneCity.com.
				<P>&quot;The passion that consumers have for unique online entertainment is rarely
				matched by any other entity on the Web,&quot; said Jim Moloshok, President of
				Warner Bros. Online.  &quot;However, eBay's unique audience appeal makes eBay the
			 	perfect partner for a company such as Warner Bros.  When you combine the
				content of Warner Bros., the commerce of eBay, and the community aspects of
				both companies, you have the magic formula for Internet success.&quot;
				<P>&quot;eBay is the place for people who are passionate about their interests and
				hobbies,&quot; said Steve Westly, Vice President of Marketing and business
				development at eBay.  &quot;Since an increasing number of people are turning to
				the Internet to find the latest information about their favorite television
				programs and celebrities, Warner Bros. popular sites provide the perfect
				venue to introduce eBay to even more entertainment buffs.&quot;
				<P>eBay banners, buttons and text links will appear across the full Warner
				Bros. Online network including the popular entertainment site located at
				www.warnerbros.com, Warner Bros. Online's branded community site AcmeCity
				and the soon to be launched vertical entertainment portal, Entertaindom.  Some
				of the sites included on the Warner Bros. Online master site focus on such
				popular brands as &quot;The Rosie O'Donnell Show,&quot; &quot;Friends,&quot; &quot;ER,&quot; "DC Comics,"
				&quot;Babylon 5,&quot; Looney Tunes&quot; and other popular mainstream appeal sites.
				<P>Fans who log onto the Web sites of Warner Bros.' programs will have direct
				access to eBay to find out what items related to their favorite programs are
				up for auction (thousands of TV-related items have already sold on the
				site).
				<P><B>About Warner Bros. Online</B><BR>
				Warner Bros. Online, a Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (NYSE: TWX),
				Is consistently in the top three of the most-trafficked studio sites on the
				Internet, according to MediaMetrix.  Producers of the successful official
				sites for "RosieO.com," "FriendsTV.com" and many other original Web
				destinations, the company focuses on producing entertainment programming for
				the Internet and commercial online services, with sites accessible through
				the World Wide Web at http://www.warnerbros.com.

				<P><I><FONT SIZE="2">eBay Becomes the Preferred Person-to-Person Online Trading Community on

				<P><I><FONT SIZE="2">Co-Branded Sites To Be Created Incorporating eBay Features,

				<FONT SIZE="-1">
				<P><B>Dulles, VA and San Jose, CA, March 25, 1999</B> -- America Online, Inc., the world's leading interactive services company, and eBay Inc., the largest online person-to-person trading community, today announced a four-year strategic alliance that will expand person-to-person commerce and community-building on AOL and its family of brands.  This agreement expands the Companies' existing strategic relationship.
				<P>The agreement gives eBay prominent presence across the domestic and international AOL family of brands, including AOL, AOL.COM, CompuServe, Netscape's Netcenter, ICQ and Digital City, and eBay will pay AOL $75 million over the term of the agreement.  In addition, AOL is entitled to all advertising revenues generated by the co-branded sites and may act as the exclusive third-party advertising sales force for advertising sold on eBay's website, www.ebay.com. 
				<P>Under the agreement, America Online and eBay will create customized and co-branded sites for America Online's multiple brands.  These sites will include comprehensive listings, feedback and ratings, message boards and select content from eBay.  With nearly 50 million auctions completed since September 1995, eBay offers AOL members the most robust and easy-to-use person-to-person trading experience anywhere online or on the Internet.
				<P>AOL will promote eBay to its member community of over 16 million members. eBay will promote AOL as its preferred Internet online service, and as future enhancements, eBay will enable its users to download ICQ on its site www.ebay.com, as well as integrate AOL's &quot;My News&quot; feature into its &quot;My eBay&quot; feature.
				<P>As a part of the agreement, the companies will work together to facilitate eBay's expansion into international markets.  AOL will also help launch eBay's expansion into regional markets through the promotion of eBay on Digital City.
				<P>Bob Pittman, President and Chief Operating Officer of America Online, Inc., said: &quot;This agreement is great for AOL members and users of our family of brands because it further expands their already dynamic online community, giving them easier access to the largest person-to-person trading community in cyberspace.  Not only does this make AOL even more valuable to their everyday lives, it makes AOL's many brands even more accessible to eBay's more than 2.1 million registered users, one of the most active communities anywhere in cyberspace.&quot;
				<P>&quot;AOL is a leader in creating and managing online communities, and eBay is in a key position to reach a much broader network of Internet users through AOL. By providing AOL users with quicker and more convenient ways to conduct person-to-person trading on eBay, we are continuing to set the standard as the leading personal e-commerce destination,&quot; said Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer of eBay. &quot;This alliance not only provides us significant customer acquisition opportunities, it serves as an important brand investment.&quot;
				<P>eBay brings to the alliance its powerful business model of person-to-person online trading, the largest marketplace of buyers and sellers online with more than 2.1 million registered users (as of December 31, 1998), and the third busiest site on the Internet in terms of total usage minutes, according to the Media Metrix February 1999 Web report.
				<P>&quot;eBay will provide AOL users a customized 'eBay at AOL' experience, including content, special features and access to special promotional auctions,&quot; said Steve Westly, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at eBay. &quot;On eBay, users will be able to access certain AOL community tools, such as ICQ, a communications portal with 30 million registrants worldwide.&quot;

				<FONT SIZE="-1">
				<P><b>SAN JOSE, Calif. March 12, 1999 - </b>
				<BR>In anticipation of the 71st Annual Academy Awards on March 21, eBay<FONT SIZE="1"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> (NASDAQ: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's leading person-to-person online trading community, is celebrating movie memorabilia throughout the month of March.  In addition to thousands of movie collectibles available on the site, eBay has partnered with Columbia TriStar Interactive (CTI) and White's Guide to Movies to host a special "Live Like A Star" sweepstakes for a trip for two to Hollywood and a tour of Sony Pictures Studios.

				<P>"This month eBay is celebrating movie making and Hollywood's greatest achievements," said Steve Westly, vice president of marketing and business development at eBay.  "Movie memorabilia is one of our most popular categories, and this time of year, we would like to help our users get into the spirit of the Academy Awards.  Although only a lucky few can attend the Academy Awards show, anyone with Internet access can experience what we like to call the 'eCademy Awards' on eBay."

				<P>eBay's movie memorabilia category currently contains more than 26,000 items up for auction, including props, wardrobe items, posters, photographs and lithographs, ranging from a "Planet of the Apes" gorilla suit to a replica of the ark in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." 

				<P>Jay Jorgensen of Los Angeles has been collecting movie memorabilia since he saw  "The Poseidon Adventure" as a kid and experienced for the first time "how spectacular movies can be."  He discovered eBay a year ago, and now visits the site daily to look for items to add to his growing collection.  Some of Jorgensen's most prized finds on eBay include a life jacket, china setting and pieces of the actual set from last year's Academy Award-winner "Titanic."  This year, he's hoping to find props from his personal pick for best picture, Academy Award nominee, "Shakespeare in Love." 

				<P>"Collecting has become much easier and more fun since I started using eBay," said Jorgensen.  "It's like going to a flea market except that I can immediately zero in on movie props, photos, posters and lobby cards that I would have never found without eBay. 

				<P><b><u>Live Like A Star Sweepstakes</u></b>
				<BR>In addition to bidding on movie related auctions on eBay, Internet users have a chance to win an assortment of prizes during the "Live Like A Star" sweepstakes hosted by Columbia TriStar Interactive.

Many of the answers to the trivia questions can be found on the Web site of White's Guide to the Movies, available at www.whitesguidetomovies.com.  White's Guide is a new monthly magazine that brings film and its stars, past and present, to life and features the latest on the Academy Awards.
