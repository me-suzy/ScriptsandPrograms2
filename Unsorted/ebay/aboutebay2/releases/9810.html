<BR><i><b>eBay Promotes Strong Sense of Community for Online Trading With 'About Me' Feature</b></i>

<P>SAN JOSE, Calif. - Oct. 15
<BR>eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's largest person-to-person online trading community, today announced the official launch of "About Me.'' This new feature provides the eBay community -- buyers and sellers -- with step-by-step instructions on how to create their own personal homepage free-of-charge on eBay. Introduced to the eBay community only last week, almost 7,000 registered users have already created homepages using this new feature. 

<P>&quot;'About Me' allows our community members to further personalize their eBay experience,&quot; said Steve Westly, eBay vice president of marketing and business development. &quot;The increased user information enables people to find out more about the people they're trading with and to more easily find people who share their interests.&quot; 

<P>&quot;About Me&quot; offers eBay's one million registered users the opportunity to create a homepage. This page can include personal information, items listed for auction, eBay feedback ratings, images, and links to other favorite sites. In addition, the easy-to-use templates allow users with little or no previous experience in Web page design to create their personal pages in minutes &#174; much quicker than the hours that might be required to complete the project on their own. 

<P>Once a user has created an &quot;About Me&quot; homepage, an icon appears next to the User ID at all times, indicating that a homepage exits. Users wishing to view these pages simply click on the icon or enter the specific URL Web address. 
&quot;I'm a novice at using HTML, and I really like how eBay made it so easy to create my own homepage with step-by-step instructions and templates,&quot; said Ann Pearson, an active eBay seller and collector with a significant number of positive feedback points. &quot;I have already given out my 'About Me' URL address to friends. eBay has made it easier and more rewarding for me to do business with others.&quot;

							<BR><i><b>Three-Year-Old Internet Company Invites Consumers to Rediscover the &quot;Joy of Finding&quot; in Online Person-to-Person Trading</b></i>
							<P>SAN JOSE, Calif. - October 13, 1998
							<P>eBay (www.ebay.com), the world's leading person-to-person online trading community, will launch its first national print and broadcast advertising campaign to increase awareness and trial of the company's brand. Created by the Acme Idea Company of South Norwalk, Connecticut, advertising will hit the national radio waves beginning the week of October 19, with a national print campaign kicking off in November.  The Acme Idea Company, a new creative consultancy, collaborated with eBay to create a campaign that heightens awareness of the service and showcases the site's broad-based consumer relevance. The advertising campaign is just one initiative in a broad-based marketing campaign launched by the newly public, three-year-old Internet company.
							<P>&quot;The primary goal for this advertising campaign is to reach consumers who aren't already familiar with eBay, and show how easy it is to find the items they've always been searching for,&quot; said Brian Swette, eBay senior vice president of marketing.  &quot;We want to give people across the country the opportunity to discover the thrill of buying and selling from individuals in an online auction format.  This advertising campaign reaches out to current and potential eBay community members in a warm, welcoming manner - no degree in 'searchology' is necessary to enjoy the eBay shopping experience.&quot;
							<P>The national radio campaign will air on more than 10,000 stations across the country for five weeks.  The November print campaign includes <i>Parade, People, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek</i> and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. Ogilvy & Mather conducted the media buy in conjunction with the Acme Idea Company.
							<P>In addition, eBay has placed a dozen different ads in over 70 distinct collecting publications, reaching people who have an active passion for coins, stamps, dolls, and photography, for example. According to eBay's agencies, this is an unparalleled media buy initiative in a vertical market.
							<P>According to Scott Kulok, Acme Idea Company creative head, all advertising must be true to the basic, humanistic appeal of eBay. &quot;We've met with and spoken to numerous people who have made eBay a part of their lives, and what they tell us is that it's not just a thrilling new way to find unique items - to many, eBay has literally changed their lives. There's something going on here on a very human level. It's a little ironic that this all happens on the Internet.&quot;
							<P>Kulok added that the campaign is designed to create awareness of this new way to find items to enrich people's personal collections; it is also respectful of the fun, inclusive, and welcoming attitude that eBay embraces.
							<P><b><i>About Acme Idea Company</i></b><BR>
							The Acme Idea Company is a newly formed strategic and creative consultancy committed to the building of brands. Principals Carol Herman, Scott Kulok, and Eva Page provide a unique perspective and track record, having collaborated on numerous successful new brand introductions, as well as significant brand repairs and turnarounds.
