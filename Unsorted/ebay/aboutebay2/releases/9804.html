							 eBay, the leading person-to-person online auction site ( 
								<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</A>
							 ), today announced that it has added eight category-specific home pages to its extensive list of trading and collectibles features. The new pages, which include computers, toys, dolls, jewelry, pottery, trading cards, coins and stamps, are designed to make it even more convenient and fun for users to locate a wide selection of their favorite collectibles. 
						</FONT>
						</P>
						<P>
						<FONT SIZE="2">
							 Each new page is divided into subcategories, and also includes featured and &quot;hot stuff&quot; items. For example, the trading card-specific page allows sports fans to easily see which collectibles are available from their favorite game such as basketball, baseball, football or hockey. Additionally, these new pages allow eBay collectors to determine which new items have been added each day within a particular category. For a collector looking for that hot, first-edition Babe Ruth card signed by the king of baseball himself, this feature provides a simple way to keep tabs on the latest rare baseball cards up for sale.

							 &quot;With varied interests and hobbies, eBay users represent a cross-section of America, and we strive to create a trading environment in which people with shared interests can connect,&quot; said Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder and CEO. &quot;By introducing category-specific home pages, we are providing customized access to the unbeatable selection of items for sale in each of our most popular categories.&quot; 
						</FONT>
						</P>
						<P>
						<FONT SIZE="2">
							 The new pages also offer discussion boards in which users can post questions about items and meet others interested in specific categories. These users can exchange information that might be considered too &quot;specialized&quot; to address in the eBay caf?, a general discussion forum popular with the eBay community. Each category-specific page is accessible from multiple locations, making it convenient for new and existing users to take advantage of eBay's diverse selection of collectibles. Users can locate these pages directly from eBay's home page, via search engines such as Alta Vista and online directories such as Yahoo, as well as through Web sites of eBay partners.

							 Bryan Sweigart, an antiques dealer in Lancaster County, Pa, believes that his antique pottery and porcelain often sells for a higher price on eBay than it would at retail, because collectors from around the world are looking at the auction site as a key resource. &quot;Through eBay, I have extended my reach to a global community of collectors, and the new pottery and porcelain-specific pages should help generate even more traffic to my auctions.&quot;

							 &quot;eBay fuels my passion for jewelry collecting,&quot; said Janette Contois, an eBay user from Mountain View, Calif. &quot;The jewelry-focused page is exciting because I can easily monitor which different items are available-vintage pieces, for example. This new feature makes eBay even more fun, because it organizes exactly what kinds of jewelry are for sale!&quot;

							 &quot;As more and more people become comfortable shopping on the Internet, it is important for e-commerce sites, such as eBay, to provide customized shopping experiences that appeal to a wide range of individuals,&quot; said Nicole Vanderbilt, group director for digital commerce at Jupiter Communications. &quot;By dividing the commerce experience into more targeted segments, commerce sites will better serve existing customers and attract new ones.&quot;

							 eBay<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> (

							 ), the leading person-to-person online auction site and one of the largest online collections of baseball memorabilia, announced today that it is hosting an impressive variety of baseball memorabilia and collectibles auctions.

							 WHAT: From baseball cards, and signed gloves, balls and bats, to pennants and baseball cigar boxes, eBay has something for everyone. As the season heats up, more and more items find their way on to the auction block. Part of the fun of trading on eBay is watching the fluctuation in value of different teams' collectibles -depending on their wins or losses. As a real-time online auction site with bidders from around the world, eBay's auctions reflect the true value of baseball's memorabilia and collectibles. 
							<P>
							 Some examples of hot baseball auctions on eBay:

							 WHY: Baseball memorabilia collectors now have a trading community online. Almost entirely fraud-free (99.99 percent), eBay is an entertaining and safe forum for trade and information sharing among collectors.

These features build trust, provide a self-monitoring trading environment and strengthen the online community. Comments from the Feedback Forum allow users to develop &quot;online reputations,&quot; holding traders accountable to the other members of the eBay community. eBay also hosts the eBay Caf*, where users exchange information about common interests and advice about buying and selling online.
