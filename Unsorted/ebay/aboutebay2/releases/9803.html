							 From the set of the &quot;Titanic&quot; to &quot;Independence Day,&quot; movie props and collectibles are a hot commodity on eBay. Everything from life jackets worn by &quot;Titanic&quot; actors to spacesuits used on &quot;Independence Day&quot; can be found on this auction site. 
							<P>
							 It's not just the &quot;silver screen&quot; that's creating a buzz on eBay. Award-winning television shows are well-represented, too. Police badges and prop guns from &quot;NYPD Blue,&quot; &quot;Law and Order&quot; and &quot;New York Undercover&quot; are all available to the highest bidder!

Most of my props are one-of-a-kind items - just waiting for the collector that knows their worth.&quot;

His &quot;Titanic&quot;-related items alone are selling like hot-cakes. &quot;The market for Hollywood memorabilia is booming, and eBay provides a great place for collectors to come together.&quot;

							 eBay<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP>, the leading person-to-person online auction site ( 
								<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</A>
							 ), announced today that the site was visited by more people in January than any other online auction site, according to Media Metrix*, the leading Web audiences measurement company. Additionally, eBay has become one of the top five most visited shopping sites on the entire Internet-the only online auction site to make the top five. eBay also announced that it has exceeded 28 million online auction bids and completed more than 7 million auctions since the company's inception in 1995. 
							<P>
							 Media Metrix's January 1998 audiences rating report, based on at-home usage of the World Wide Web, shows that eBay is one of the top five most visited shopping sites, with nearly 1,000,000 unique visitors each month. The report also indicates that the average eBay shopper spends more than 23 minutes per usage day on the site. This figure ranks first among the more than 50 sites listed within the shopping category in the report. 
							<P>
							 &quot;The number of Internet users visiting eBay has increased rapidly during the past 12 months,&quot; said Douglas McFarland, Media Metrix senior vice president and general manager. &quot;In January, eBay usage soared, making the site one the five most popular shopping sites on the entire Web, along with online shopping powerhouses such as Amazon.com.&quot; 
							<P>
							 eBay Growth Spurred by Strong Sense of Community &amp; Wide Selection of Auctions 
							<P>
							 &quot;More than 275,000 auctions are conducted each day now on eBay, and our unprecedented growth has made us the number one auction site on the Web,&quot; said Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder and CEO. &quot;Hundreds of thousands of people have chosen eBay over other online auction sites because we offer the most diverse selection of merchandise, the safest and most reliable place to trade, and the strongest sense of friendship and community among users.&quot; 
							<P>
							 Bruce Nicklin, of Riverside, Calif, began selling used computer parts on the Internet almost two years ago. After discovering eBay, he was able to retire from his job in sales and marketing at one of Maytag's corporations, and estimates that he has sold at least three million dollars of merchandise through the online auction site in less than two years. 
							<P>
							 &quot;The sense of trust and community that eBay users share is a major reason I've been so successful in growing my business on the Web,&quot; said Nicklin. &quot;eBay has truly changed my life, both from a financial standpoint, as well as by allowing me to meet wonderful people from around the country and the world.&quot; 
							<P>
							 Janette Contois, a jewelry collector in Mountain View, Calif., discovered eBay three months ago and is impressed with the quality and prices of the treasures she has found and purchased through eBay. 
							<P>
							 &quot;The selection of jewelry listed on the site is incredible, and I love the thrill of bidding on and winning an auction,&quot; said Contois. &quot;I've gotten to know and trust many of the people I buy from, and have had only positive experiences on eBay.&quot; 
							<P>
							 &quot;Online auctions such as eBay are one of the fastest-growing shopping categories on the Web,&quot; said Nicole Vanderbilt, group director for digital commerce at Jupiter Communications. &quot;The success of an online shopping site stems from its ability to provide a secure and easy-to-use environment from which buyers and sellers can conduct business and share a strong sense of community.&quot;

							 In addition, the Alliance recently conducted an in-depth study on eBay that produced a case study. Written by Katie King and Michael Miloff, the case study concludes, &quot;Whatever the final destiny of eBay, its extraordinary success to date has begun to dramatically transform the landscape for personal trading. It forces all of us to think about the power and techniques of online auctions and community building.&quot;
