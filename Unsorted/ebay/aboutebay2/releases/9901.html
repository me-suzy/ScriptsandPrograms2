						<i>-- Secures Position as the Second Most Popular Site on the Internet --</i></H4>
						<FONT SIZE="-1">
						<P>San Jose, Calif. Jan. 29, 1999 -
						<P>eBay<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> (NASDAQ: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's leading person-to-person online trading community, today announced that it is ranked the second most popular site on the Internet, when measured by total user minutes per month (696 million total user minutes), according to Media Metrix December 1998 Web report. 

						<P>As a result of the close relationship eBay has built with its community, the site provides high user satisfaction and continues to attract large numbers of new registered users. 

						<P>"My experience on eBay has been fraud-free," said Bill Bryant of San Jose, Calif., an avid collector of aviation memorabilia.  "In the past six months I have bought over 100 items on eBay and have had only very positive experiences with sellers. It's pretty clear to me that the issue of fraud between buyers and sellers has been blown way out of proportion in recent weeks and does not reflect the majority of eBay user experiences."

						<P>Shanna and Wayne Bumbaca of Sheridan, Wyo., with the help of a full-time employee, average 1,000 transactions on eBay each week.  They started trading on eBay in June 1997 and now earn their living entirely by selling artwork, mainly loose and framed prints, on eBay.  

						<P>"My experience on eBay has been amazing," said Shanna.  "All eBay users that we have conducted business with have been very honest. eBay certainly keeps us busy, but we have a lot of fun with it."   

						<P>"My business has tripled this past year because of eBay," said Jon Bertolino, owner of Toizrit Inc. in Elgin, Ill.  He sells collectible toys and vintage writing instruments, such as diecast Hot Wheels from the 1960s through the 1970s and Parker pens from the 1920s through the 1950s, on eBay.  "I am amazed with the new forum that eBay has provided for my business and ecstatic with the success that I have found on the site.  The quality of buyers on eBay continues to impress me."

						<P>Due to the tremendous growth of his sales on eBay, Jon has eliminated most of his print advertising and direct mailings to buyers.  "eBay is just wonderful.  Not only is my business booming, but also I have more time to focus on my personal life.  Instead of continuous phone calls from buyers, I just post a picture and description on eBay, and the check arrives in the mail."

						<P>According to the Media Metrix report, eBay is the number three shopping site and the 20th most visited site on the Internet, when measured by percent reach.  eBay's consolidated reach is 9.9 percent, representing approximately 5.6 million unique viewers. 

						<P>"From October to December 1998, eBay's community grew from 1.2 million registered users to 2.1 million registered users, an increase of 72%. Over three years, eBay's exponential growth is the equivalent of growing from a small village into a major metropolitan area roughly the size of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose combined," said eBay president and CEO Meg Whitman.  "eBay offers the broadest selection of items for sale anywhere on the Internet - and quite possibly in the world -  with more than 1.4 million items up for auction each day in more than 1000 categories.   In fact, every minute of every day more than 150 new items are listed, more than 500 bids are placed, and seven new people register on eBay." 

						<P>While less than 1/100 of one percent of the millions of transactions conducted on eBay have a reported fraud complaint, eBay aggressively works to prevent fraud and has recently instituted and intensified a number of initiatives to eliminate negative experiences on the site.  eBay's comprehensive SafeHarborTM program was established to promote safe online trading as well as protect the community from fraud, the sale of illegal or infringing materials and people that would misuse the system.

						<P><b>About eBay</b>
						<BR>eBay (www.ebay.com), the world's personal trading community√§, pioneered person-to-person online trading.  Founded in 1995, eBay has developed an efficient and entertaining trading site on the Web that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  eBay has more than two million registered users. Currently, there are more than 1.4 million items listed for sale.  More than 200,000 items are added daily in more than 1,000 categories, including: antiques; books, movies and music; coins and stamps; collectibles; computers; dolls and figures; jewelry and gemstones; photo and electronics; pottery and glass; sports memorabilia; and toys.

						<H4><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A NAME="5">eBay's response to the investigation by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs</A></FONT></H4>
						<FONT SIZE="-1">
							<P>"eBay is eager to work with law enforcement regarding alleged fraudulent items sold on the site," according to Meg Whitman, eBay president and CEO. "We have zero tolerance for fraud.  

							<P>We invite the New York Department of Consumer Affairs to share with us any and all information in this alleged case.  We will make it our up-most priority to cooperate and resolve this issue."

							<P>It is unfortunate that the basis for several articles in the New York Post is attributed to an "unnamed source."  This makes it hard to directly address this issue.

							<P>To date, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs has made no requests for either information about eBay users or regarding eBay's internal policies for handling fraud complaints. Whitman stated, "Should New York City Department of Consumer Affairs decide to pursue an investigation, we pledge to work with the agency and cooperate fully to help resolve the issue."
 
							<P>According to Whitman, "It has always been eBay's practice to cooperate fully with any investigation involving improper or illegal activity by users on the site. We take pride in our community of 2.1 million users and our close working relationship with law enforcement and regulatory agencies. While less than 1/100 of 1 percent of the millions of transactions have a reported fraud complaint, eBay takes every one seriously.

							<P>While we do not have liability, we do have a responsibility to our community of users with respect to fraud prevention. Our responsibility-and one we take seriously-is to provide eBay users with effective tools, including insurance and escrow, that promote a safe trading environment. 

							<P>Since the company was founded three years ago, eBay has taken numerous, significant steps to help ensure its users that they have safe and successful auctions." 

							<P>Two weeks ago eBay announced even more SafeHarbor tools for users to utilize before, during and after the auction. Following is a list of the current and soon-to-be introduced 'Trust & Safety' resources on eBay:

							<P>Highlights of eBay's SafeHarbor trust and safety program includes:
							<UL>
							<LI>Free insurance from Lloyd's of London
							<LI>User registration validation with upcoming "Verified eBay User" status with accompanying icon 
							<LI>Comprehensive Feedback Forum 
							<LI>Easy to access to escrow 
							<LI>Tough Deadbeat Bidders and Shill Bidding policies 
							<LI>Clarification of illegal items that are not permissible for sale 
							<LI>Strong anti-piracy and anti-infringement program under the Legal Buddy program
							<LI>24/7 customer support
							<LI>Close working relationship with law enforcement agencies

							<P>HOUSTON and SAN JOSE, January 25, 1999

							<P>In a step to make buying and selling on the Internet easier, Compaq Computer Corporation (NYSE: CPQ), the largest global supplier of computing systems and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), the world's largest person-to-person online trading community, today announced a strategic U.S. co-marketing relationship.

"eBay's partnership with Compaq now makes it even more convenient for business people and new computer owners to jump right in to begin browsing, shopping and selling on eBay."

							<P>Compaq's customer Choice model allows customers to configure and buy Prosignia products and services directly from Compaq through its DirectPlus Web site at http://www.directplus.compaq.com, by calling 1-800-888-9909 or from their local Compaq authorized Reseller/direct marketer of choice.

							<BR><i>eBay's New "Gallery" Feature Revolutionizes the Online Person-to-Person Trading Community</i></H4>
						<FONT SIZE="2">
							<P>San Jose, Calif. Jan. 25, 1999

							<P>eBay(tm) (NASDAQ: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the world's leading person-to-person online trading community, today announced a revolutionary feature that gives online trading a whole new look - the eBay "Gallery."  Providing users with a more intuitive way to browse and place bids, the eBay Gallery showcases auction items in a catalog of pictures rather than text. The result for eBay users is a fun and richer trading experience.

							<P>"The eBay Gallery will dramatically change the way people trade online.  We are enabling our users to navigate through the site in a faster and more efficient, visually appealing format," said Brian Swette, senior vice president of marketing for eBay. 
	
							<P>Unique to eBay, the Gallery is currently available in the "Antiques" category and will be rolled out into other eBay categories within the next few months.  This new proprietary technology, patent pending, was developed in-house at eBay. "We have created sophisticated technology that indexes hundreds of thousands of images real-time every day and presents them to our users in a compelling way," said Mike Wilson, vice president product development and site operations. 

							<P>Feedback from the eBay community inspired the development of the Gallery.  eBay users requested a more visually exciting shopping experience to add to the thrill of bidding on unusual, hard-to-find and gotta-have items.

							<P>"This new technology is enabling people to experience eBay the way they experience the world - visually," continued Swette.  "Browsing through the eBay Gallery is like strolling through the mall and window shopping.  With pictures to spark their curiosity, users will not only enjoy looking at the categories they usually visit, but also explore different areas and find new items of interest."

							<P>When eBay users select a category, they will have the option to browse items up for auction in the Gallery or via the standard text format.  While the text mode lists items in a column by title, items in the Gallery appear as a series of pictures with the title, current bid and remaining auction time listed below.  Users may click on an individual image for more details about that particular auction.  Similar to the text listings, the Gallery offers the highly popular "Featured Auctions," in which specific items are highlighted within each category.

						<H4><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A NAME="2">eBay<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> Launches The Most Comprehensive  Trust And Safety Upgrades To The World's Largest Person-To-Person Trading Site</A></FONT>
							<BR><i>Online community to benefit from free insurance,  SafeHarbor(tm) 2.0 and the Legal Buddy Program 2.0 as eBay continues to ensure a safe and fun place on the Internet for person-to-person trading</i></H4>
						<FONT SIZE="2">
							<P>San Jose, Calif. Jan. 15, 1999  

							<P>eBay(tm) (www.ebay.com, NASDAQ: EBAY) -- the world's leading person-to-person online trading community -- announced today the release of its updated SafeHarbor and Buddy Programs.  SafeHarbor(tm) 2.0 and the Legal Buddy Program 2.0 are comprehensive programs that help promote safe online trading as well as protect the community from fraud, the sale of  illegal or infringing materials and people that would misuse the system. 

							<b>Highlights of the comprehensive trust and safety program:</b>
							<UL>
								<LI>Free insurance from  Lloyd's of London
								<LI>Verified eBay User status with accompanying icon
								<LI>Enhanced Feedback Forum
								<LI>Easy access to escrow
								<LI>Tougher Deadbeat Bidders and Shill Bidding policies
								<LI>Clarification of illegal items that are not permissible for sale
								<LI>Strengthened anti-piracy and anti-infringement program
							</UL>

							<P>While less than 1/100 of 1 percent of the millions of transactions have a reported fraud complaint, eBay takes every one seriously.  Since it was founded in 1995, eBay has instituted a number of safety tools and resources including the Feedback Forum in Feb. '96 and SafeHarbor in Feb. '98. to actively work with the community and law enforcement agencies.   eBay is now expanding this industry-leading program and providing even more with new tools and safeguards to make the site a safe place to trade online.
 
							<P>"eBay has zero tolerance for fraud,"  stated Meg Whitman, eBay president and CEO.  "These new upgrades to the SafeHarbor and Legal Buddy Programs are designed to meet the demands of our growing community.  While fraud and other trust and safety issues are not new, eBay's solutions are.  We have committed and will continue to commit resources to have the most comprehensive programs in order to keep eBay a safe harbor for online person-to-person trading." 

							<P><b>SafeHarbor(tm) 2.0</b>
							<BR>eBay vigilantly looks to protect its community and has created SafeHarbor 2.0 with new mechanisms added to its existing ones to help complete successful transactions, research complaints, and work with law enforcement agencies to investigate, arrest and convict fraudulent buyers or sellers on eBay.

							<P><i>Verified User Program</i>
							<BR>Currently, when a person joins the eBay community, they submit contact information that is verified at the time of registration and periodically updated to confirm its validity.  In March '99, a new voluntary program -- <b>Verified eBay User</b> -- will encourage users to supply eBay with additional information for online verification.  By offering their social security number, driver's license number and date of birth, users will, at an introductory price of $5, qualify for the highest level of verification on eBay. Verified eBay User status with accompanying icon means other eBay members can conduct transactions with added confidence in the identity of the user.  All users' information will be protected under the eBay Privacy Policy and used exclusively for verification purposes.

							<P>"As a dedicated eBay member, I am in favor of the Verified eBay User program," stated Brent Peterson, an eBay user with 587 positive feedback points.  "Now when I look up a user's profile, I will look for the Verified eBay User icon.   For me, this symbol next to their name is another added level of confidence and trust."

							<P>To provide this online verification information, eBay will partner with Equifax Secure Inc., a division of Atlanta-based Equifax Inc., a trusted provider of consumer and business information.  In evaluating the identity of the user, Equifax will compare and analyze the information provided by the user against consumer data from Equifax and other consumer and business information sources.  The transfer of all private member information will be secure and encrypted. 

							<P><i>Feedback Forum</i>
							<BR>At the core of the eBay community is the <b>Feedback Forum</b>, where registered buyers and sellers build up their online trading reputation.  The Feedback Forum provides users with the ability to comment on their experiences with another individual.  This creates a user feedback profile, which follows the user everywhere on eBay.  Enhancements to the Feedback Forum will distinguish between feedback tied to a transaction (with the item number) and general feedback.  In addition, for easier reading, responses and clarifications to comments will now be tied together to encourage further dialogue.

							<P><i>Insurance</i>
							<BR>By March '99, SafeHarbor 2.0 will automatically provide <b>insurance</b> from Lloyd's of London for users (with a net non-negative feedback rating) on their auctions up to $200, subject to a deductible of $25. eBay and Lloyd's of London have designed this program to set a new standard for safe online trading at no cost to the user. 

							<P>For items over $200 or when either a buyer or seller feels the need for additional security, eBay recommends <b>escrow services</b>.  With an easy to access link to a third-party escrow service, both partners in the deal will be protected. 

							<P><i>Shill Bidding Policy</i>
							<BR>Trust within the community is lessened when a user makes a bid on an item with the intent to drive up the price of item and not to purchase it.  With a new tougher <b>shill bidding policy</b>, eBay drives home the message that it does not tolerate shill bidding on one's own items either directly or through the use of multiple identities.  The policy now clearly states there is a 30-day suspension for first time offenders and indefinite suspension following a second offense.  

							<P><i>Deadbeat Bidder Policy</i>
							<BR>To help protect sellers, clear policy guidelines are also being set forth for <b>deadbeat bidders</b>, a community-coined word for bidders who do not honor their commitment after winning an auction.  Since there can be extenuating circumstances, first time non-payment results in a friendly warning.  A sterner warning is issued for a second time offense with a 30-day suspension for a third offense and indefinite suspension for the fourth offense. This feature takes effect immediately and works independently of the Feedback Forum.

							<P>An additional upgrade to SafeHarbor 2.0 is the <b>further clarification of illegal items</b> that are not permissible for sale on eBay.  As clearly outlined in the User Agreement, eBay does not allow the posting of items that are in violation of laws, statutes, ordinances or regulations.  To further define this point,  eBay will post a partial reference list of  less obvious non-permissible items, which include live animals, human relics and remains, bulk email lists and other items.

							<P><b>Legal Buddy Program 2.0</b>
							<BR>The Legal Buddy Program has been upgraded by strengthening the ongoing relationship between eBay and Content Owners, the owners of intellectual property rights or copyrighted items.  eBay is currently working with more than 100 industry-leading companies from software publishers to toy manufacturers to apparel makers.

							<P>Once notified by a Content Owner, eBay will remove illegal or unlicensed items.   To help alert Content Owners, eBay has developed numerous tools, including an <b>automated daily key word search</b> for Content Owners to use to quickly enable them to find potentially infringing auction items.  <b>Dedicated email accounts</b> will be established for Content Owners to contact eBay to remove the questionable items.

							<P>When items are removed from the site an email notice will be sent to the seller as well as any bidders, directing them to the Content Owner for further information.  Many Content Owners are providing an <b>educational "About Me" Web page</b>  to give users further information about copyrighted or other infringing items, what is permissible and not permissible to sell, FAQs and a company contact to discuss the authenticity of the item.  

							<P>Enforcing SafeHarbor 2.0 and the Legal Buddy Program 2.0, the SafeHarbor Team currently consists of 24 members.  This dedicated staff works around the clock to remove items and suspend users for inappropriate behavior.  The Team diligently investigates and pursues claims of fraud and inappropriate or infringing items and works closely with local, state and Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FTC, FBI, ATF, state attorneys general and the Postmaster General.

							<P>As the community has always defined eBay, these changes to the SafeHarbor and the Legal Buddy programs will be launched in concert with community input and involvement in the first quarter of the year.  Beginning next week, eBay will host discussions and invite community members to post their input on the "Discuss eBay's Newest Features" board. In addition, conforming changes will be made to the user agreement and Community Guidelines to take into account the new SafeHarbor 2.0 and Legal Buddy Program 2.0.

							<P>"We applaud eBay for taking these innovative steps to reduce the potential for problems with online auction transactions," said Susan Grant, director of the National Consumers League's Internet 

							<P>Fraud Watch (IFW) program.  "Providing more reliable information about sellers and preventing shills from abusing the system should give consumers more confidence in bidding for items."  The IFW program, which can be reached through www.fraud.org, offers advice to online shoppers and relays consumers' reports about suspected Internet fraud to law enforcement agencies. IFW's online auction tips, including how to pay the safest way, are featured on the eBay site.

							<P>eBay is changing the way people collect by opening the world of the Internet to people from across the country to share their passion for collectibles, hard-to-find items or other auctionable items.

							<BR><i>eBay to Begin Auction January 5 on the Internet; Guernsey's to Conclude Bidding January 12 at Madison Square Garden</i></H4>

							<P>SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 4 

							<P>/PRNewswire/ -- The opportunity to own a piece of 
baseball history starts tomorrow on eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY; www.ebay.com). Four 
Mark McGwire and three Sammy Sosa 1998 home run balls will be auctioned in 
a manner perhaps as historical as the balls themselves. The auction will 
begin at eBay, the world's largest person-to-person online trading 
community, where qualified bidders may place bids January 5 through January 
11. The next day, January 12, Guernsey's, the New York auction house, will 
conclude the auction at Madison Square Garden in what is believed to be the 
first-ever On-Live(tm) auction.

							<P>The auctions will consist of four Mark McGwire home run balls, including 
the 63rd, 67th, 68th, and the record smashing 70th ball, and Sammy Sosa's 
61st, 64th, and 66th balls. In addition, other historic baseballs will be 
available for auction On-Live, January 12. Anyone interested in following 
the auction can look for the "Home run Ball" link on eBay, check out 
"...other happenings" on eBay's home page, or go directly to 
http://www.pages.ebay.com/aw/homerun-ball.html

							<P>The online portion of the historic auction will begin with seven, 
individual private auctions on eBay beginning January 5 at 12 p.m. PST. On 
January 11 at 12 p.m. PST, the eBay auctions will close and the top three 
bids from each home run ball will advance to the On-Live portion. The 
On-Live auction will begin at 9 a.m. PST on January 12 at Madison Square 
Garden with a minimum bid equal to the highest bid from the online auction. 
Each of the three online bidders will place bids in traditional eBay proxy 
fashion -- placing the highest bid amount they would pay for the item. The 
eBay system will increase their bids automatically relative to other bids, 
both online and On-Live, until reaching that maximum bid.

							<P>"Hosting this historic sports auction is truly an honor for eBay," said 
Steve Westly, eBay vice president of marketing and business development. 
"Never before has such a prestigious auction of America's greatest pastime 
been available to the online community. The online format brings this 
historic auction to a broader audience of people who have never been able 
to participate in an auction of this scale before."

							<P>Online bidders will have the opportunity to increase their maximum bid a  
nytime during the auction. Bidding against the three online bidders will be 
a number of On-Live bidders at Madison Square Garden. Linking them together 
will be a large screen displaying the eBay Web page hosting the auction.

							<P>"This is the big auction that everyone has been waiting for and Guernsey's 
is thrilled to contribute to baseball's history," said Arlan Ettinger, 
president of Guernsey's. "The combination of an online and On-Live auction 
hosted by Guernsey's and eBay signifies one of the most historic sports 
memorabilia collecting events to date. Truly, this unique partnership will 
offer sports memorabilia collectors worldwide an opportunity to bid on a 
piece of history."

							<P>History of These Home Run Baseballs
							<BR>Major League Baseball's magical season climaxed on September 27, 1998, when 
Phil Ozersky caught Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball at Busch Stadium. The 
70th ball is the crown jewel of this unique auction, but all the baseballs 
have their own place in history. On September 15, Mark McGwire stepped to 
the plate against the Pittsburgh Pirates and belted home run number 63 
(450th of his career), which was caught by John Grass in the left-center 
field stands at Busch Stadium. On September 26 in St. Louis, McGwire came 
to the plate in the fourth inning against Montreal and smacked home run 
number 67 into left field, where Douglas Singer was waiting, glove ready, 
to make history. In that same game, McGwire's 68th home run ball went to 
Heath Wiseman, a student from Iowa State University.

							<P>While McGwire was chasing a piece of history in St. Louis, someone was 
chasing McGwire in Chicago. McGwire's friend, Sammy Sosa, was also closing 
in on Roger Maris' record. Sammy Sosa's 61st home run ball, the one that 
tied Roger Maris' former record, will be a part of this live auction, with 
all the proceeds being donated to The Sammy Sosa Charitable Foundation. 
Also up for auction will be Sosa's 64th home run ball, caught by Veron 
Kuhlemeier in the right field stands of Milwaukee's County Stadium on 
September 23. Perhaps most impressive is the sale of Sosa's historic 66th 
home run ball, representing the second most home runs hit in a single 
season, hit on September 25 and currently owned by Albert Chapa.

							<P>A catalog describing each of the stories behind the seven home run balls is 
available from Guernsey's. The catalog features color photos of each ball 
and historical anecdotes from the famous home runs. Guernsey's, located at 
108 East 73rd Street in Manhattan, is recognized as one of America's 
leaders in conducting specialized auctions of unique and rare 20th century 
objects. Some of Guernsey's more noted auctions include the JFK collection, 
the contents of the S.S. United States (the world's largest auction) and 
the first auction of artwork from the Soviet Union. Other sales include the 
art of Walt Disney, vintage carousel figures, and historic international 
racing cars.
