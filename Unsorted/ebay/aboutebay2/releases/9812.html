							<BR><i>eBay Promotes Hasselblad's Auction of Ansel Adams' Photo Equipment, Proceeds to Benefit Charity</i></H4>
						<FONT SIZE="2">
							<P>San Jose, Calif., December 14, 1998

							<P>Photo enthusiasts and anyone who has ever been inspired by the photographs of Ansel Adams have the opportunity to bid on a piece of history.  Hasselblad USA Inc. is wrapping up a two-year auction that ends at midnight on December 18 for Ansel Adams' photography equipment.  All proceeds will benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the Center for Creative Photography.  Information about the offline auction is available on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), the world's largest person-to-person online trading community, at http://pages.ebay.com/aw/hasselblad.html. 
 
							<P>"We are honored to participate in the promotion of Hasselblad's Ansel Adams' camera auction," said Steve Westly, vice president of marketing and business development at eBay.  "These timepieces have captured extraordinary images of American landscape.  Ansel Adams' cameras are truly a part of American photographic history."

							<P>Ansel Adams initially offered the use of his camera equipment to his assistant, Rod Dresser.  At the time, Adams' health was deteriorating, and according to Dresser, he was concerned with ensuring that his lenses get enough "exercise."  Adams passed away in 1984, and in 1996, Dresser returned the equipment to its original creators, Hasselblad USA Inc. 

							<P>"We have an outstanding need to spread the word that these cameras are available," said Skip Cohen, president of Hasselblad USA Inc.  "eBay's site is absolutely amazing, with the variety of items up for auction that appeal to all types of collectors and hobbyists.  eBay provides the perfect way for us to reach out to people with a common interest in photography and raise as much money as we can for the charities."

							<P>Seventy-five percent of the proceeds from the auction will be donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the only national nonprofit foundation identifying funding and conducting critical pediatrics AIDS research worldwide.  The remaining twenty-five percent will benefit the Center for Creative Photography, founded by Ansel Adams in 1975 in Tucson, Arizona, which houses the works of more than 2,000 photographic artists.  Nationally syndicated radio personality Don Imus, whose program originates out of WFAN in New York, currently holds the highest bid at $100,000.

							<P>Information about the Ansel Adams camera package can be found under eBay's "Photo & Electronics" category and on eBay's "Happenings" section, both accessible from the home page.  eBay has one of the largest collections of photographic equipment on the Internet.  Currently, more than 8000 photographic items, more than 60 items related to Ansel Adams, and more than 160 Hasselblad items are available for auction on eBay, as well as more than 5000 artistic images. 

							<P>The Ansel Adams equipment package includes one Hasselblad 500C body; one 500EL body; one SuperWide camera; one each of four lenses: 80mm, 50mm, 150mm and 250mm; three A12 magazines, one A16 magazine, a Polaroid back; and Adams' original aluminum case.  Hasselblad USA Inc. is considered the premier medium format camera company and this year celebrates its 50th anniversary.

							<P>Formal bids should be directed in writing to Skip Cohen at Hasselblad USA Inc., 10 Madison Road, Fairfield, N.J. 07004, 973-227-7320 (phone), 973-227-3249 (fax).  Bidding will officially close at midnight on December 18, 1998.

						<H4><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A NAME="1">Mark Mcgwire And Sammy Sosa 1998 Home Run Balls To Be Auctioned By Guernsey's In Alliance With eBay</A></FONT>
							<BR><i>Items to be Auctioned January 12 at Madison Square Garden</i></H4>
						<FONT SIZE="2">
							<P>New York, December 8, 1998

							<P>Guernsey's, the New York auction house, in alliance with eBay (www.ebay.com), the largest person-to-person online trading community, announced today the sports auction of the century.  The auction consists of seven famed baseballs along with other significant memorabilia from baseball's magical 1998 season, as well as other historical baseball items.  

							<P>Four Mark McGwire home run balls, numbers 63, 67, 68, and the record smashing 70th ball and three 1998 Sammy Sosa home run balls, numbers 61, 64, and 66 are the highlights of this extraordinary auction.  The collection of baseballs will be auctioned by Guernsey's January 12, 1998 at Madison Square Garden.    

							<P>"This is the big auction that everyone has been waiting for and Guernsey's is thrilled to contribute to baseball's history," Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's said.  "This exceptional auction celebrates baseball's most exciting season and brings together several pieces of renowned memorabilia for the world to see."

							<P>One week prior to the January 12 live auction, in what is considered to be the first-ever On-Live<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> auction, eBay will host the online component of the Sosa and McGwire home run ball auction. On January 5, eBay will launch six, individual private auctions, including images of the record-breaking baseballs. In addition, eBay will promote the auctions on its Web site at http://pages.ebay.com/aw/homerun-ball.html as well as sell the auction catalogs. 

							<P>"As pioneers in online trading, we are excited to partner with Guernsey's, a well-respected auction house, to bridge the world of Internet auctions with live auctions for the very first time," said Meg Whitman, president and chief executive officer, eBay. "This much-awaited event can now be witnessed by people around the world."

							<P>Major League Baseball's magical season climaxed on September 27, 1998, when Phil Ozersky caught Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball at Busch Stadium.  The 70th ball is the crown jewel of this unique auction.
 
							<P>The other McGwire baseballs to be auctioned off on January 12 all have their own place in history.  On September 15, Mark McGwire stepped to the plate against the Pittsburgh Pirates and belted home run number 63 (450th of his career), which was caught by John Grass in the left-center field stands at Busch Stadium.

							<P>On September 26 in St. Louis, McGwire came to the plate in the fourth inning against Montreal and smacked home run number 67 into left field, where Douglas Singer was waiting for it to land in his glove.  In that same game, Heath Wiseman, a student from Iowa State University, eagerly caught McGwire's 68th home run ball. 

							<P>While McGwire was chasing a piece of history in St. Louis,  a new rivalry began with his  friend Sammy Sosa in Chicago, who himself began to challenge records with his 61st home run.  Sammy Sosa is donating his 61st home run ball, the one that tied Roger Maris' former record, with all the proceeds going to The Sammy Sosa Charitable Foundation.  

							<P>Veron Kuhlemeier was sitting in the right field stands of Milwaukee's County Stadium on September 23 when Sammy Sosa crushed home run number 64, a fastball that landed in his glove.  The 66th ball, which represents the second most home runs ever hit in a single season, came off Sosa's bat on September 25 and now belongs to Albert Chapa. 

							<P>A catalog describing each of the stories behind the seven home run balls is available from Guernsey's.  The catalog features color photos of each ball and historical anecdotes from the famous homeruns in history.

							<P>Guernsey's, located at 108 East 73rd Street in Manhattan, is recognized as one of America's leaders in conducting specialized auctions of unique and rare 20th century objectives. A brief sampling of Guernsey's sales includes the auction of JFK collection, the contents of the S.S. United States (the world's largest auction) and the first auction of artwork from the Soviet Union, as well as a myriad of diverse and fascinating sales such as the art of Walt Disney, vintage carousel figures and historic international racing cars.
