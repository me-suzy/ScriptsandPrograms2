						<BR><i>Furbies Are Selling Out In Stores, But The World's Largest Collection Can Be Found Online At eBay Today</i></H4>
</H4>
						<FONT SIZE="-1">
							<P>San Jose, Calif., November 24, 1998
							<P>The Furby<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> frenzy has already begun.  Like Tickle-Me-Elmo<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> last year, toy experts are calling these interactive dolls the "must-have" hottest toy of the season.  Their intense popularity has made them almost impossible to find - parents wait hours in line before stores open and fight for the last Furby.  Consumers can easily avoid the chaos by going online and bidding on a selection of more than 2,000 Furbies up for auction on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY; www.ebay.com/aw/furbies.html), the world's largest person-to-person online trading community.

							<P>"Holiday shoppers are scrambling to find Furbies and quickly realizing they are nearly impossible to find in stores," said Steve Westly, eBay vice president, marketing and business development.  "We're happy to let holiday shoppers know that thousands of these sought-after toys are available at eBay today.  We've even started a special Furby page, making it even easier for people to find them on our site."

							<P>Since the craze kicked off this fall, well over 6,000 Furbies have already sold on eBay. The site lists a wide selection of these favorite furry creatures, from gray Furbies with black spots and pink tummies to rare solid white and original black and white.

							<P>First introduced in October, Furbies have been selling as soon as they reach stores and show no signs of slowing down.  These furry critters actually speak and interact with people and each other.  Furbies come in a variety of color combinations and stand at five inches tall.  Running on batteries, Furbies blink their eyes, wiggle their ears, speak, and sing.  They even dance, sneeze, purr, and burp.  

							<P>Furbies speak their own language, "Furbish," but "learn" English by listening to their owners.  They communicate with other Furbies and people, react to tickling, music, and loud noises, fall asleep in the dark, and may even snore.  Furbies also learn songs and games.  Made by Tiger Electronics, Ltd., a division of Hasbro, Furbies are for kids ages six and older, but appeal to people of all ages.
