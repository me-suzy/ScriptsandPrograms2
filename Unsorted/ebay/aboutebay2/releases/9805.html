							 San Jose, Calif.- May 18, 1998 
							<P>
							 eBay, the world's personal trading community<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> ( 
								<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</A>
							 ), today introduced a new user ID feature which shields email addresses of its members, protecting them from unsolicited email, or &quot;spam.&quot; Now, email addresses of traders are available only to other eBay users through password-protected requests. These aliases eliminate the ability of other companies or unregistered individuals to obtain eBay members' addresses and to send unsolicited email. 
							<P>
							 eBay was founded with the premise that the company operated within an open and honest marketplace where users did not need to disguise their email addresses. However, in recent months, registered eBay users have been spammed by competitive online auction companies. By collecting eBay members' email addresses through an automatic software program, or a &quot;robot,&quot; these companies are not only violating eBay rules by invading member privacy, but are also threatening to disrupt service for legitimate users. 
							<P>
							 &quot;Spamming is an inappropriate business practice, and it is unfortunate that it has become necessary to protect our members from junk email sent by other companies,&quot; said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of eBay. &quot;However, we believe that we have created a solution which protects email addresses from spam, while at the same time, upholds the established community values that our legitimate users respect and reinforce themselves.&quot; 
							<P>
							 To address the growing need to protect its members from these invasions, eBay has developed a user ID option, where eBay members can select a unique nickname, or alias, which differs from their email addresses. The alias makes it difficult for &quot;robots&quot; to harvest email addresses, while protecting communication between members of the eBay community. To access a fellow trader's email address, a registered user simply clicks on that person's user ID and enters his or her own eBay information. eBay will reveal that person's email address, allowing legitimate users to communicate quickly and effectively and to consummate trades in a way that does not expose them to unwanted spam. 
							<P>
							 &quot;The legal battle over companies' right to spam consumers as a form of mass-marketing is heating up,&quot; added Whitman. &quot;eBay takes this debate seriously and is addressing the issue now, before any legislation is passed, to preserve the privacy of its users. By offering precautionary measures such as user IDs to protect users from spam, eBay continues to maintain a safe and secure place to shop online.&quot; 
							<P>
							 &quot;eBay is the only online auction site that I choose to do business with,&quot; said Jeffrey Warantz, a registered eBay user. &quot;When I receive spam promoting other auctions, I know that the senders found my address on eBay's site. This new feature should help eliminate the unwanted intrusion of receiving spam from other companies.&quot;
