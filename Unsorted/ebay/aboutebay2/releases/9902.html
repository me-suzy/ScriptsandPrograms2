				<i>Founder of eBay to Host Reception at 1999 PEZ&reg;-A-THON Convention</i></H4>

				<FONT SIZE="-1">
				<P>Los Angeles, Feb. 24, 1999 - Collectors of PEZ&reg; candy dispensers are invited to attend the only international PEZ convention held west of the Rocky Mountains, taking place March 26-27, 1999 in Los Angeles.  The 1999 PEZ&reg;-A-THON convention will be kicked off by Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay<FONT SIZE="1"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> (www.ebay.com; NASDAQ: EBAY), the world's leading person-to-person online trading community.

				<P>"This year's convention will be better than ever," said 'Jolly' Jim Presnal, producer of the PEZ-A-THON convention.  "We are pleased to have Mr. Omidyar at this year's show. PEZ collecting played a vital role in the inspiration of eBay."

				<P>Pierre Omidyar initially developed the eBay Web site in 1995 partly to help his wife, an avid collector of PEZ dispensers, find trading partners. Currently there are more than 1,700 PEZ-related auctions happening on eBay. 

				<P>The value of older PEZ dispensers has increased steadily since the early 1990s.  Some rare variations sell in excess of $5,500 - all for a dispenser that originally sold for 29¢.  In fact, a rare 1950s PEZ Rocket Ray Gun sold on eBay for $5,555.55.  Despite the high prices paid for some older dispensers, the hobby continues to attract new collectors. The reason why?  PEZ Candy, Inc. still produces the candy and dispensers by the millions, and children of all ages can begin their own collections with the current dispensers for only 99¢ a piece.

				<P>eBay and Sparky's<FONT SIZE="1"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, the largest single-store retailer of PEZ and PEZ-licensed products in the world, are the sponsors of the 1999 PEZ-A-THON.  The event will be held at the Manhattan Beach Marriott Hotel, 1400 Parkview Avenue (off of Rosencrans, one mile west of 405) in Los Angeles.  The event is open to the public.

				<i>New Partnership Expands eBay Into Australia and New Zealand Region</i></H4>

				<FONT SIZE="-1">
				<P><b>San Jose, CA, February 24, 1999</b> - 

				<P>In a step to make buying and selling on eBay easier to users in Australia and New Zealand, PBL Online, a leading Internet media company in Australia, today announced a joint venture with eBay, the world's largest person-to person online trading community. Under the agreement, later in 1999, users will be able to access a customized Australian and New Zealand eBay home page. The other terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

				<P>"The partnership is an great opportunity for PBL Online to introduce the eBay service in Australia and New Zealand.  We are very excited to be working with eBay, one of the world's leading e-commerce companies," said Daniel Petre, Chairman of PBL Online.

				<P>eBay is the second most popular site on the Internet in the United States, when measured by total user minutes per month (696 million total user minutes), and is also the number three shopping site, according to the December 1998 Media Metrix Web report.
		
				<P>From October to December 1998, eBay's community grew from approximately 1.2 million registered users to approximately 2.1 million registered users, an increase of 72%. Over three years, eBay's exponential growth is the equivalent of growing from a small village into a major metropolitan city.

				<P>"We are looking forward to working with PBL Online, our first international joint venture for eBay," said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of eBay. "We believe that PBL Online is one of the best positioned Internet media companies in the region. We are enthusiastic about welcoming more Australian and New Zealand users into our international trading community."

				<H4><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A NAME="3">eBay To Stop User Listings Of Firearms And Ammunition On The Site</FONT></A></H4>
				<FONT SIZE="-1">
				<P><B>SAN JOSE, Calif. Feb. 19, 1999</B>  

				<P>eBay<FONT SIZE="1"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> (NASDAQ: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the worlds leading person-to-person online trading community, today announced that it is ending user listings of all firearms and ammunition on the site.   The decision was based on the determination that the Internet is not an appropriate venue for this kind of merchandise. Effective March 5, 1999, firearms will not be listed in any categories, including the &quot;Firearms,&quot; &quot;Antique,&quot; &quot;Collectibles,&quot; and &quot;Sport&quot; categories.</P>

				<P>&quot;While we acknowledge the gun collectors and sports enthusiasts among our users, eBay takes its role as a responsible member of the online community very seriously,&quot; said Steve Westly, vice president of marketing and business development at eBay.  &quot;After careful consideration of the issue, we believe the process of buying and selling firearms online is sufficiently different from the offline world, and it is appropriate for us to end the user listing of firearms on eBay.&quot; </P>

				<P>To meet the March 5, 1999 deadline for eliminating the &quot;Miscellaneous: Firearms&quot; category from the site, users may list firearms in that category until Feb. 26, 1999. After that date, eBay will remove any firearms listed on the site. </P>

				<P>Westly added that online sellers cannot readily guarantee that buyers meet all the qualifications and comply with the laws governing firearm sales.  eBay had previously raised the possibility of instituting changes to the Firearms category. After having investigated a variety of methods to ensure public safety without eliminating the firearms category, eBay concluded that, in consideration of current technology and laws, no alternative met eBays standards. </P>

				<P>&quot;We realize that the sale of firearms is a controversial issue, and our stance will spark support as well as criticism,&quot; continued Westly. &quot;We are also sensitive to the effect that this policy may have on serious gun collectors.  After thorough evaluation, we have decided to end all user listings of firearms and ammunition on eBay in the interests of our site, our users and the offline community.&quot;</P>

				<P>Firearms-related items, such as holsters, literature, clothing and scopes, may still be sold on eBay, but only listed in the &quot;Collectibles: Western Americana,&quot; &quot;Collectibles: Militaria&quot; and &quot;Miscellaneous: Sporting Goods: Hunting&quot; categories.</P>

				<P>As part of the ongoing dialogue with its community, eBay will host public forums on Monday, Feb. 22, 1999, from 2:00 to 4:00 PST and on Tuesday, Feb. 23, 1999, from noon to 2:00 PST on the &quot;Discuss eBays Newest Features&quot; board, to answer any questions from community members about the firearms policy.</P>

				<i>Establishes Charitable Foundation Funded by Donation of 107,250 Shares of Pre-IPO Stock</i></H4>

				<FONT SIZE="-1">
				<P><B>SAN JOSE, Calif. Feb. 17, 1999</B>  
				<P>eBay<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> (NASDAQ: EBAY; www.ebay.com), the worlds leading person-to-person online trading community, is reaching beyond the boundaries of its virtual village to assist communities in the United States and around the world.  eBay established the eBay Foundation with funding from pre-IPO stock to provide grants to local and global nonprofit organizations. </P>

				<P>"eBay is setting a significant example for corporate philanthropy,&quot; said Peter Hero, president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley, a public charity organization that facilitates corporate gift-giving.  &quot;Donating pre-IPO stock makes sense financially for the company and results in a bonanza for charity as the company increases its shareholder value.  eBay is unique because it is actively participating in charitable giving early in its corporate life rather than as an after-thought."</P>

				<P>&quot;Since its inception, eBays mission has been to develop a strong, positive environment where people with common interests come together,&quot; said Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay and advisor to the eBay Foundation.  &quot;We created the eBay Foundation to take that philosophy one step further  to link people with the resources that will empower them to improve not only their own lives, but also the community around them.&quot;</P>

				<P><B>About the eBay Foundation</B>
				<BR>The eBay Foundation, established in June 1998 as a separate entity from eBay Inc., is funded by eBays donation of 107,250 shares of its common stock to Community Foundation Silicon Valley (CFSV).  The CFSV is a tax-exempt, public charity whose mission is to promote philanthropy and build a strong community by assisting donors in making effective charitable donations and making grants to a variety of nonprofit organizations across the nation. </P>

				<P>In November 1998, a team of eBay employees volunteered to form a governance committee to direct the Foundations efforts.  A cross-section of eBay employees from such departments as engineering, marketing, and customer support are responsible for selecting grant recipients.</P>

				<P>&quot;The eBay community has always been extremely generous,&quot; said Jeff Skoll, vice president of strategic planning and analysis for eBay.  &quot;eBay users are very responsive to our charity auction fundraisers and to the eBay Giving Board, where users post their needs and others offer what they can to help out.  In the altruistic spirit of our community, were thrilled to complement these efforts through the eBay Foundation.&quot;</P>

				<P><B>eBay Foundations 1998 Grants</B>
				<BR>The eBay Foundation awarded its first two grants in December 1998 to &quot;Friends of Farm Drive&quot; and the University Research Expedition Program (UREP).  Friends of Farm Drive is a nonprofit organization working to improve the quality of life for residents in a San Jose, Calif. neighborhood rampant with drug dealing and gang activity.  The organization runs two  community centers where volunteers assist with homework, teach English as a second language, arrange monthly food donations, staff innoculation clinics and administer tuberculosis testing and treatment.  The eBay Foundation will help to fund a summer recreation program targeting &quot;high risk&quot; youths.  The grant will also fund the creation of a computer learning center, where volunteers will work with youths and adults to assist them in gaining valuable computer skills.</P>

				<P>The University Research Expedition Program (UREP), based in Davis, Calif., is an organization that sends volunteers on two-week expeditions to learn about archaeology, anthropology, environmental studies and earth sciences.  The grant will provide scholarships for California elementary and high school teachers to participate in the programs, working with university scientists in countries around the world.  Teachers will not only have the opportunity to work with local residents about such issues as preserving their rainforests, but also to share with their students at home what they have learned abroad. </P>

				<P>&quot;The first two recipients of eBay Foundation grants epitomize our goals and philosophy,&quot; said Karin Stahl, member of the eBay Foundations advisory board.  &quot;The programs provide long-term and far-reaching benefits for their participants and those they touch in communities around the world.  We selected these charities to help foster the growth of children and adults by providing both the basic needs for survival and the knowledge they need to succeed in the future.&quot;</P>

				<P><B>Funding Criteria</B>
				<BR>The eBay Foundation is currently accepting applications for 1999 funding.  Grant criteria and application details are available on eBay at http://www.ebay.com/aboutebay/foundation/index.html. Grants are awarded to programs or projects that leverage existing resources, foster collaboration by various organizations to achieve a greater impact, empower individuals to improve their lives, benefit the local or global community at large, or make a significant positive, long-term impact on the people served. </P>
