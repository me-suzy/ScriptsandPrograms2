							<P>
							 eBay, the world's personal trading community<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP> ( 
								<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</A>
							 ) today announced the acquisition of Jump, Inc., the developer and operator of Up4Sale ( 
								<A HREF="http://www.up4sale.com">www.up4sale.com</A>
							 ), an advertising-supported trading service in an auction format. eBay acquired Jump in order to provide it with an additional environment in which to introduce complementary future services. Launched in 1997, Up4Sale currently has 45,000 items listed in 27,000 separate auctions and 50,000 registered members. eBay currently operates Up4Sale as an independent service. 
							<P>
							 &quot;The founders and employees of Up4Sale share eBay's vision of what it takes to be the world's personal trading community<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP>,&quot; said Meg Whitman, president and chief executive officer of eBay. &quot;We believe that the long-term relationship between eBay and Jump will ultimately bring a great deal of value to our communities.&quot; 
							<P>
							 &quot;We are truly excited about our association with eBay. We at Up4Sale have been longtime admirers of eBay and the wonderful community that exists there,&quot; said Rob Ratterman, co-founder of Up4Sale.

							 Users must register before they can bid or sell on Up4Sale. Currently, neither buyers nor sellers pay fees to bid on or list items for auction. Once an auction is successfully completed, the buyer and seller then independently complete the sale.
