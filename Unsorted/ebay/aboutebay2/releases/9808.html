							 San Jose, Calif., August 10, 1998 
							<P>
							 eBay ( 
								<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</A>
							 ), the world's personal trading community<SUP><FONT SIZE="1">TM</FONT></SUP>, today announced the debut of its new fan-based, online Elvis destination site, &quot;All the King's Things.&quot; The site, inspired by a book authored by eBay employee and Elvis expert Robin Rosaaen, provides a place for fans of &quot;The King&quot; to buy and/or sell &quot;all things Elvis&quot; from their personal collections of memorabilia. Located at 
								<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/elvis/">www.ebay.com/elvis</A>
							 , the site will also provide entertaining and educational features such as an Elvis Museum, an Elvis chat room, Elvis Collector of the Week highlights, and articles from magazine partners as well as Elvis fans and friends. 
							<P>
							 &quot;With more than 50,000 Elvis fans coming together offline for the Elvis Week 1998 festivities in Memphis this week, we couldn't think of a more appropriate time to add another level of excitement for the eBay Elvis fan community,&quot; said Steve Westly, eBay vice president, marketing and business development. &quot;This way Elvis fans anywhere in the world can celebrate their love for the King.&quot; 
							<P>
							 At this time, eBay has more than 150 new Elvis items for auction every day, ranging from mint-condition trading cards and personal belongings to records and autographed photographs. &quot;It was this enthusiasm for the King in the eBay community that drove our choice for a destination Web page on our site,&quot; added Westly. 
							<P>
							 According to Elvis expert Rosaaen, &quot;Elvis' one-of-kind charisma and magnetism make him dear to many people, and now for the first time Elvis fans from all over the world can interact 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to really celebrate Elvis and the countless items he inspired.&quot; Rosaaen, who was called Rockin' Robin by the King himself, is known for having one of the largest Elvis collections in the country and has appeared as an Elvis expert on Geraldo and Oprah Winfrey as well as other national news and talk shows. 
							<P>
							 The Elvis Museum on eBay showcases highlights from Rosaaen's personal collection of more than 40,000 Elvis items, which she has developed during the last 30 years. Her vast collection includes a blue suede jacket worn by Elvis on several occasions (appraised at $7,000), a lock of his hair (one recently sold for $5,000) and an assortment of concert and security artifacts from 1969 - 1977 (articles valued at $50 - $1,000). Rosaaen will be available to answer questions from the eBay community through the &quot;Ask the Expert&quot; site feature and her participation in the Elvis chat room. All inquiries from Elvis fans can be sent to elvis@ebay.com.
