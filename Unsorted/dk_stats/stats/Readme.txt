This readme file is intended to help you set up the Stats.
Check if all the files are present:
- readme.txt (this file)
- counter.php
- counter_admin.php
- stats.php
- mysql.txt
- connect.php

Note: Setting up this site stats script requires some knowledge of Mysql and PHP! It's a bit hard but should work for you!

counter.php should be included in your index.php file so that every visit is counted. stats.php displays the stats for you. connect.php should include your username and password for the Mysql database. counter_admin.php is made to give you the stats you want, its very detailed and easy to use.

Just upload the files included.
Now use phpMyAdmin, if installed on your server, to make the tables in the MySQL database.
The descriptions are available in the mysql.txt file.

Thats all - hope it works out for you!
