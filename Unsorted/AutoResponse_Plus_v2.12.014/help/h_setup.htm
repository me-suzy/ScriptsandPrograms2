<p>When you click on <font color="#000080"><strong>Setup</strong></font> (Step 1), you
will see the <font color="#000080"><strong>System Setup</strong></font> screen where you
can edit various properties of your Autoresponse Plus system. Most of them can be changed
in this screen. The first two can only be changed by editing the file 'paths.pl' which can
be found in the Autoresponse Plus scripts directory. this is usually <em>.../yourdomainorwhatever/...etc.
etc/cgi-bin/arplus</em>. 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data file path</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the absolute path to the directory on your server where Autoresponse Plus
  stores it's data. The directory cannot be changed here. To change the directory, you need
  to edit the file 'paths.pl' which you will find in your Autoresponse Plus scripts
  directory. 'paths.pl' is normally edited only during the installation procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your web site URL</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the address of the web site where Autoresponse Plus is installed. You can
  change this by editing the file 'paths.pl' which you will find in your Autoresponse Plus
  scripts directory. 'paths.pl' is normally edited only during the installation procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your domain</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the domain where Autoresponse Plus is installed. It should be in the simple
  format <em>yourdomain.com</em>. There should be <strong>no</strong> http:// or www or
  /index.html etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>URL of your Autoresponse Plus scripts directory</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will be something like <em>http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/arplus</em>. There
  should be no slash at the end. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Path to your sendmail program</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enter here the absolute path to your server's sendmail program. This is usually
  something like <em>/usr/bin/sendmail</em>. If you are not sure what to enter here, contact
  your host's support desk for assistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your support e-mail address</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enter the address of your own support desk. This is the address which your contacts can
  send e-mail to if they need help when using your Autoresponse Plus system. Error pages
  that your contacts may see have a link to this e-mail address.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>System e-mail address</strong><p>This e-mail address is used for two purposes:<ul>
      <li>To send out e-mailed confirmations when a contact unsubscribes from an autoresponder.</li>
      <li>To send out one-off e-mails generated by the 'Batch E-mail' option on the subscriber
        list screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Show news banner?</strong><p>Check this box to display the current AutoResponse
    News banner. The banner shows details of updates and other AutoResponse Plus news. Click
    on the banner for further information on any of the topics shown.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>We strongly recommend you check this box to prevent data corruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Login cookie life</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the Autoresponse Plus login screen there is a check box which says 'Remember Next
  Time?'. When you check the box, your owner name and password will automatically be
  completed the next time you visit the login screen. This value is the number of days the
  system will remember your details until you have to enter them again. Set this value to
  zero (0) if you want your details to be remembered only until you close your browser at
  the end of the current session.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>E-mail failures</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The system automatically handles bounced or undeliverable messages. This value is the
  number of failures that will be allowed for each subscriber. When this number is exceeded,
  the subscriber's status will be changed to 'Failed<strong>' </strong>and no more messages
  will be sent.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the number of subcribers that will be shown on a single screen on the

<ul>
  <li><strong>Force default personalization?</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are using personalization tags in your messages, check this box to use the
  default values in the tags instead of your subscriber's details. For example, if you
  message contains {FIRSTNAME Internet_Marketer} then every recipient will see
  &quot;Internet Marketer&quot; and not their first name.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Show sub menu bar tool tips?</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you move your mouse over the options in the sub menu bar, a pop up will tell you

  off.</p>

  <li><strong>Custom success and failure pages (There are four)</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When contacts subscribe or unsubscribe to your autoresponders they will see the default
  confirmation pages which are built into the system. You can create and use your own
  default custom pages if you wish. Enter their URL's here. Custom pages can also be defined
  for each tracking tag so that you can use different custom pages depending on the source
  of the subscription. The URLs for these pages are entered in the Tracking Tags section.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Affiliate link text</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the &quot;Include Affiliate Link?&quot; check box is checked in the page setup of
  an autoresponder, each message will have your affiliate link at the end. The default link
  text is <em>Powered by Autoresponse Plus</em>. This text can be changed here. You can also
  include the link text anywhere else in messages, headers, footers, subjects and signatures
  using the tag {AFFILIATE_LINK_TEXT}. The link itself can be included using the tag
  {AFFILIATE_LINK}.</p>
</blockquote>

  an autoresponder.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unsubscribe link text</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the &quot;Include Unsubscribe Link?&quot; check box is checked in the page setup
  of an autoresponder, each message will have a single-click &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link at
  the end. The text which is displayed with this link can be changed here. You can also
  include the link text anywhere else in messages, headers, footers, subjects and signatures
  using the tag {UNSUBSCRIBE_LINK_TEXT}. The link itself can be included using the tag
  {UNSUBSCRIBE_LINK}.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unsubscribe confirmation e-mail text</strong></li>

  e-mail confirmation on unsubscribe?&quot; box is checked.</p>
