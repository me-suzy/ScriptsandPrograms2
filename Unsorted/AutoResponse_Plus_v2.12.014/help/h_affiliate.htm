<p><font color="#000080"><strong>AFFILIATE PROGRAM</strong> </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>You can earn money simply by using Autoresponse Plus!</strong></font></p>

<p>At the time of writing, Autoresponse Plus costs $149 and professional installation
costs $80. As an Autoresponse Plus affiliate you will earn a very healthy 35% commission
for every sale that you generate for us. </p>

<p><strong><font size="3"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">You can earn a very
attractive <font color="#FF0000">$80.15</font> for simply sending the prospect to our web
site and letting us make, process and support the sale.</span></font></strong></p>

<p>Obviously it's impossible for us to predict how much you could make as an Autoresponse
Plus affiliate - but imagine if you generate just two sales of the software including
professional installation per day. Your commission would be over $4800 per month. 3 sales
per day would be over $7200 per month. 4 sales per day would be over $9600 per month....,
and so on. </p>

<p>Of course, there are no guarantees that you will make this much. You could make less or
you could make much more. </p>

<p>We know that most prospects you send to our site will not buy Autoresponse Plus<strong>
</strong>immediately. That's why we track them for 90 days after their first visit. If
they return and purchase within 90 days of you sending them to us, your commission will be
added to your account. </p>

<p>ClickBank run our affiliate program for us. They retain your proportion of any sale and
mail out your check every two weeks - like clockwork! They have a great system which
allows you to check your commission balance in real time, 24 x 7. </p>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Now here's the best bit.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>You can earn money simply by using your Autoresponse Plus
system! </strong></font></p>

<p>Your Autoresponse Plus software already has our affiliate program built right in. By
making one simple change to your Autoresponse Plus system's settings, your unique
affiliate link will be added to the end of all your follow-up messages. </p>

<p>This takes the form of a discrete <em>Powered by Autoresponse Plus </em>link. If
someone clicks on it, they will be redirected to our home page. If they make any purchases
within the next 90 days, you get a generous 35% of all those sales.</p>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Getting started is easy and takes just minutes! </strong></font></p>

<p>Using a very simple, four stage process, you can get started within minutes... </p>

<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Check out our affiliate agreement By signing up to our
affiliate program, you agree to it's terms and conditions. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Create your ClickBank account They run our affiliate program
and send your checks twice a month. It's completely free to join. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter your affiliate nickname into your Autoresponse Plus
system Click on the <strong>Your Profile</strong> link on the menu bar and enter the
affiliate nickname you created at ClickBank. </p>

<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Add your unique affiliate link to all outgoing messages Go
into the<strong> Page Layout</strong> option in each of your autoresponders and check the <strong>Include&nbsp;Affiliate&nbsp;Link</strong>
option. </p>

<p>Now every plain text or HTML follow-up message your Autoresponse Plus system sends out
will have your unique <em>Powered by Autoresponse Plus</em> link at the end. </p>

<p><em>Example...<br>
</em>Suppose you send us a prospect and they choose to buy a $149 license for Autoresponse
Plus. You get $52.15 commission. A few days later, that same person decides to order our
professional installation service which costs $80. You get $28.00 commission. From one
visitor you have earned a total of $80.15 commission. </p>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>And all you did was use your Autoresponse Plus system to
promote your business! </strong></font></p>

<p>That tiny <em>Powered by Autoresponse Plus </em>link at the end of your follow-up
messages did all the work for you! </p>
