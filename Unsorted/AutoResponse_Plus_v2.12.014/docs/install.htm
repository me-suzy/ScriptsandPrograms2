      <li>You need to know the path to Perl on your web server. This is usually #!/usr/bin/perl.
        If you are unsure, contact your host's support desk.</li>
      <li>You need to know the path to the sendmail program on your web server. This is usually

    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 1: Unzip the AutoResponse Plus files onto your
    computer</strong></font></p>
    <p>Use your unzipping software to unzip the AutoResponse Plus zip file into a temporary
    folder on your PC. Make sure you select the option to use folder names or preserve
    directories when unzipping. If the unzip is successful, your temporary folder will contain
    these folders:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>data</li>

    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 2: Setting the path to Perl</strong></font></p>
    <p>In the 'scripts' directory, there are several files that contain the path to Perl on
    your server. The first line in each of these files may need to be changed (using a text
    editor) to show the correct Perl path for your server. The files to edit are:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>arplus.pl</li>
        <li>daily.pl</li>
        <li>emailcapture.pl</li>

    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 3: Setting up the 'cgi' directories</strong></font></p>
    <p>Using your FTP client, log into your web server. Assuming your CGI-BIN directory is
    called 'cgi-bin', create the following directories. Please note that these are
    case-sensitive. Also, set the CHMOD or permission of each of these directories to 0777
    [drwxrwxrwx].</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>cgi-bin/<font color="#000080">arplus</font></li>

    <hr noshade size="1" color="#000080">
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 4: Setting up the 'non cgi' directory</strong></font></p>
    <p>In the public part of your web space (usually the directory is called 'public',
    'public_html', 'html', 'htdocs' etc), create the following directory. There is no need to
    set any permissions. For this example, we assume your public html directory is 'htdocs'.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>htdocs/<font color="#000080">arplus</font></li>

    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 5: Editing your 'arp-paths.pl' file</strong></font></p>
    <p>Before uploading the files, you need to edit two lines in the file 'arp-paths.pl' which
    is located in your 'scripts' directory. Use a text editor and follow the instructions in
    the file.</p>
    <hr noshade size="1" color="#000080">
    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 6: Transferring the files to your web server</strong></font></p>
    <p>Using your FTP client, upload the files from each of your local directories and set the
    permissions as shown in the table. Again, we assume that your CGI-BIN directory is
    'cgi-bin' and your public html directory is 'htdocs'.</p>

    <p><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 10 : Setting up the cron job</strong></font></p>
    <p>Once per day, AutoResponse Plus needs to send out any due follow-up messages. At this
    time it will also send out any one-off messages you have queued. This process is managed
    automatically by a cron job running on your web server. Some hosting services provide a
    web based interface for creating and maintaining cron jobs. If this is the case, follow
    the instructions provided by your host.</p>
    <p>More often however, you will need to set up the cron task manually through telnet. Here
    is a detailed explanation of the procedure.</p>
    <p>You can check if your system is already running other cron jobs from the telnet prompt.
    Login to your web server using your telnet client and enter the command <strong>crontab -l</strong>
    [lower case L]. If cron jobs are already running, you will need to add what follows to the
    end of your existing cron file rather than creating a new one.<ul>
      <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 10(a) : Creating your cron file</strong></font></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This contains a single line description of the automated task - what has to be run and
      when. The 'other' directory on your PC contains an example cron file called 'arpcron'
      which you can edit and use. An example is shown below.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="center">30 23 * * * /usr/bin/perl /path/to/your/cgi-bin/arplus/daily.pl</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#000080">IMPORTANT NOTE: The path to 'daily.pl' you enter is from your <strong>**host's</strong>**
      server root and not <strong>**your</strong>** domain's root directory. Sometimes these are
      the same. It would be normal for your domain or login name to appear somewhere in this
      path.</font></p>
      <p>The 30 23 * * * in the example tells UNIX that the job should be run every night at
      23:30 hours (11.30pm). This can be set to whatever time you choose. If you change 30 23 to
      * *, the cron taks will run once per minute. Although you would never normally use this,
      it will allow you to test that the cron task is working -- see step 10(c) below.</p>
      <p>If your server is already running a cron job, you will need to add your command line to
      the existing cron file. You can check if your server is already running any cron jobs by
      typing <strong>crontab -l</strong> (lower case L) at the telnet prompt.</p>
      <p>Assuming your server is not already running cron jobs, upload your cron file using
      ASCII mode to a location on your web server that does not have public access (like your
      login root directory or a sub-directory of it).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 10(b) : Running crontab to set up the cron job<br>
        </strong></font><br>
        Login to your server through telnet and navigate to the directory where you just stored
        'arpcron'. Assuming your cron file is called 'arpcron' as in our example, type the command
        <strong>crontab arpcron</strong> and hit Enter. You should simply get the UNIX prompt
        back.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The command <strong>crontab -l</strong> (lower case L) will show you that the cron job
      is active and the command <strong>crontab -r</strong> will cancel the cron job, should
      this ever be necessary.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Step 10(c) : Running a test cron task<br>
        </strong></font><br>
        As described above, if you set the cron task's time to * * * * *, it will run once per
        minute. When you install AutoResponse Plus, the install program creates a test
        autoresponder called<strong> test</strong>. It has an immediate message plus two
        follow-ups that are scheduled to be sent out each time the cron task runs.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>So set the cron task to run once per minute (remember to run <strong>crontab arpcron</strong>)
      and then subscribe yourself to the autoresponder called <strong>test</strong> by sending a
      blank e-mail to test@yourdomain.com. You will receive the first message immediately. One
      minute later you will receive the second message and a minute after that you will receive
      the third.</p>
      <p>This tells you that the cron task is working correctly. You can then safely set the
      time back to 30 23 in the cron file. Remember you need to run <strong>crontab arpcron</strong>
      to activate the changes you made to the file.</p>
