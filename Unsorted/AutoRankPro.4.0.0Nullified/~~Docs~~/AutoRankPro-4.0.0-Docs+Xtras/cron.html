Before you begin working with cron, it is imparitive that you have at least a basic understanding
of several concepts, and have the proper access to your server.  Without knowing these things, you
will have an extremely difficult time getting the cron scripts to work properly.

<br><br>

Your server must allow the following:

<br><br>

- Telnet or SSH access<br>
- crontab access<br>
- Ability to setup multiple cron jobs

<br><br>

If you are not sure that your hosting company allows the above access on their servers, contact them
before you begin.  You will not want to spend the time getting everything configured, if you do not 
have the proper priveleges to run the cron jobs on your server.

<br><br>

You must understand each of the following:

<br><br>

- Unix commands (cd, chmod, etc)<br>
- Uploading files in ASCII mode<br>
- Setting variables in perl scripts<br>
- Editing ASCII text files<br>
- Full Unix directory paths<br>
- Using telnet or SSH to access your server

<br><br>

If there is anything you do not understand in the list above, you will need to educate yourself on that
item(s) before you proceed.  Our tech support staff will assist you if you run into problems, however we
simply do not have the resources to educate people about the items above.  There are many tutorials available
on the WWW covering most of the items above.  Take the time to learn about them if you don't already understand
them.

An entry consists of two parts - a time to run, and a command to run. 

<br><br>

The time to run (the first part of the entry) is broken up into 5 fields:<br> 
1. minute of the hour <br>
2. hour of the day (on the 24 hour clock) <br>
3. day of the month <br>
4. month of the year (1 = January, 2 = February, etc.) <br>
5. day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ..., 6 = Saturday) <br>

<br><br>

A * in one of these fields indicates that the job should be executed 
at any or every one of these, so for instance a * in the month of the 
year field means that this task should be carried out every month at the 
time specified in the other fields. A * in the day of the week field, 
when there is something in the day of the month field, does not mean that 
this task should be carried out every day, but rather that it should be 
carried out on the appointed day of the month regardless of what weekday 
it is. Only *s in the day of the week field, and the day of the month 
field, and the month of the year field would indicate a daily task. 

<br><br>

Examples:<br>
In the examples, [command] represents the full path and filename of the file you want
to execute.

<br><br>

The job with this time to run would run every Sunday at 12:20 am. <br>
20 0 * * 0 [command]<br>
This job would run at midnight on any Friday the 13th. <br>
0 0 13 * 5 [command]

<br><br>

You don't have to put just one time in a field. This job, for instance, would 
run every day at 12:30am, 2:30am, 4:30am, 6:30am, 6:30pm, 8:30pm, and 10:30pm: <br>
30 0,2,4,6,18,20,22 * * * [command]
<br><br>
This one would run every Tuesday and Friday at 5:30 am: <br>
30 5 * * 2,5 [command]

<br><br>

<br>

To get started you will need to edit the cron.cgi file included with the AutoRank Pro distribution.  This file can 
be edited in a text file editor of your choice.  Locate the line that looks like the following:

<br><br>

$CDIR = '/home/soft/cgi-bin/arp';

<br><br>

You will need to change this variable so that it points to the full path to the directory where you have installed
the software.  You only need to edit the portion inside the single quotes.  Once you have setup the correct directory
path, you can save this file.  Note that if perl is not located at /usr/bin/perl on your server, you will need to adjust
the first line of this file to point to the correct location of perl on your server.

<br><br>

Next you need to open the sample cronfile included with the software distribution.  The default setup has the script
reranking every 30 minutes at 15 and 45 past the hour, resetting the list at midnight server time daily, and clearing 
the IP log files at 10 after midnight daily. If you would like them to run at different times than this, you will need
to adjust the entries according to the information provided above. It is highly recommended that you do not have any
of the scripts run at the same time. 

<br><br>

Next you will need to change the following portion of each command:

<br><br>

/path/to/cron.cgi

<br><br>

This will need to be changed so that it points to the cron.cgi file on your server.
If you have any other cron jobs running on your server, make sure to include those
in the cronfile as well. 

<br><br>

Once your cronfile is setup how you want it, you can save that file.  Now you need to upload these two files to your server.
They should be uploaded in ASCII mode to the same directory where the cgiworks.pm and arp.pl files are located.  Once uploaded,
change the permissions on the cron.cgi file to 755.

<br><br>

Now you need to telnet (or SSH) into your server, and change into the directory where you have uploaded cronfile. Once in that
directory, issue the following command: 

<br><br>

crontab cronfile

<br><br>

This will enter all of the commands in cronfile, and the server will begin executing them at the selected times. To double check
your crontab entries, you can issue the following command (note the character following the - is a lower case L): 

<br><br>

crontab -l

<br><br>

      <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">

          <td bgcolor="#000000">

            <table width="100%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0">
              <tr>

            </table>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- END HEADER -->

<br>

To test your setup, you will need to login to your server via telnet or SSH.  Once logged in, make sure you are not in the directory
where the cron.cgi file is located.  Copy the full command to rerank the list from the cronfile you are using, but do not include the
time settings.  For example if your cronfile looks like this:

<br><br>

15,45 * * * * /home/myaccount/cgi-bin/toplist/cron.cgi --mode=rerankList

<br><br>

You would run the following command:

<br><br>

/home/myaccount/cgi-bin/toplist/cron.cgi --mode=rerankList

<br><br>

Running this command should result in no output, and return you directly to the command prompt.  You can then login to your administrative
interface to verify that the list has been reranked.  It should also indicate that cron was used for the most recent rerank.
