Use these instructions to upgrade from v4.0.x to any newer version in the v4.0.x series.

<br><br>

<ol>

<li> Upgrades between these versions are very simple.  All you need to do is upload the new files to your server.  All
of the files that need to be uploaded are listed below.  You <b>should not</b> run the autorankpro.cgi script when 
upgrading between versions of 4.0.x

<br><br>

<b>Main Directory</b>
<br>
accounts.cgi<br>
arp.pl<br>
quick.cgi<br>
cgiworks.pm<br>
imgsize.pm<br>
http.pl<br>
out.cgi<br>
random.cgi<br>
rankem.cgi<br>
search.cgi<br>
sort.pl

<br><br>

<b>Admin Directory</b>
<br>
admin.cgi<br>
setup.cgi

<br><br>

<b>Data Directory</b>
<br>
errors.dat<br>
lang.dat

<br><br>

<b>Templates Directory</b>
<br>
All _admin_*.htmlt templates<br>
_rankem.cgit

<br><br>

<li> Once all of the files have been uploaded, your upgrade is complete.  If you have created a customized gateway page, you
will need to create a new one at this time and update your rankem.cgi script.

</ol>

<b>Important Notes</b>

<br><br>

If Perl 5 is not located at /usr/bin/perl be sure to update the first line of all .cgi files with the correct path to
Perl on your server.

<br><br>

Unless specially noted in the ChangeLog or recent news, it is not necessary to upgrade any of the add ons when a new version
of AutoRank Pro is released.

<br><br>

Make sure you upload all of the files in ASCII mode!

<br><br>

It is not necessary to delete any files from your server before you upload the updated scripts.  If you do delete any files,
make sure you reset all permissions on the files you upload.
