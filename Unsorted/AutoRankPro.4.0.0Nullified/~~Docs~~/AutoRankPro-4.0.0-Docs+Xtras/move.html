As you may know, finding a great host for your website can be very difficult.  Because of this, it is sometimes required
that you move to a new server at a new hosting company.  This document will give you an overview of what needs to be
done in order to transfer AutoRank Pro and your data to a new server.

<ol>

<li> The first thing you will want to do is backup your databases from the old server.  This is easily done through
the administrative interface using the database backup feature.  Once you have generated your backup file, download
it to your local computer in ASCII mode.  The backup feature will backup most things for you, however if you
have edited any of the .htmlt or .etmpl files you will need to transfer those to your new server seperately.

<br><br>

<li> Next, you will need to install AutoRank Pro on your new server.  It is very important that you do not copy any files
over from your old server.  You should proceed with the installation as if it is the first time it is being installed.  Follow
the instructions in <a href="install.html">install.html</a> to complete the installation.  Once you have done that, you can upload
any customized .htmlt or .etmpl files to your templates directory, if you haven't already.

<br><br>

<li> After you have the new and clean installation done on your new server, upload the database backup file to your data directory 
in ASCII mode.  Set the permissions on the database backup file to 666.

<br><br>

<li> Now you can enter the administrative script on your new server, and use the database restore function.  Type in the filename
of the backup file, and use the restore function.  All of your data will be recovered in this process.

<br><br>

<li> Once you have restored your data, you will want to rerank the list to generate the ranking pages.

<br><br>

<li> That's all there is to it.  You are now ready to continue normal operations.

</ol>

Please note that this is the only method for switching servers that is supported by CGI Works.  If you do it any other way
we will not be able to provide technical assistance for errors you encounter.
