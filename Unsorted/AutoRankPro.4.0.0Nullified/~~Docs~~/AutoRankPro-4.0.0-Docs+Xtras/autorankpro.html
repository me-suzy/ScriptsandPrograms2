These upgrade instructions are for upgrading from AutoRank Pro v3.0.x only.  They will not work for older versions
of the software or the freeware version.  You should allow at least 30 minutes to complete the upgrade, and more time
if you have customized versions of the accounts.cgi templates.

<ol>

<li> Login to your v3.0.x administrative interface and run the database backup function.  Download the backup file to your
local computer for safe keeping.  This can be used to restore your v3.0.x installation should you need to.

<br><br>

<li> Upload the autorankpro.cgi file from the v4.0.x distribution to the directory on your server where AutoRank Pro is
currently installed.  Make sure you upload in ASCII mode and change the permissions on the file to 755.  You can now point
your browser to this file, and it will convert the necessary data.

<br><br>

<li> Next you can upload all of the files from the v4.0.x distribution to your server in the corresponding folders.  The only file
you do not need to upload is the .htaccess file from the admin directory - all other files should be uploaded.  Complete
details on what folders each file goes into and file permissions can be found in the install.html documentation file.

<br><br>

<li> Log into your administrative interface and click on the Edit Variables and Options link.  You will need to go through and enter
each of the setup options.

<br><br>

<li> Finally, in the administrative interface you need to run the rerank function.  Once you do that, look at your ranking pages
to make sure everything is correct.  If you are using cron to update your list, you will need to setup the new cron script and
crontab entries.  See the cron.html documentation file.
