AutoRank Pro has several methods of cheat protection including complete IP tracking, double CGI, gateway sessions, and cookies.  Here
we will discuss how they work, and what type of cheating they prevent.  We will also discuss the cheat log so you can understand how
to interpret it.

<br><br>

<b>Complete IP Tracking</b>

<br><br>

The first method of cheat protection is complete IP tracking.  Put simply, a log of IP addresses is kept for each member.  Each time
a new click is sent, the script checks the IP logs to see if that IP has clicked through before.  If it has, the click is not counted
and a cheat is (optionally) recorded in the cheat log.  In setup.cgi you can tell the software how often it should clear the IP logs.
If you only want one hit per IP per day, set that value to 86400.  To keep the software execution times and sever load low, we recommend
that you clear the IP logs at least once each day.

<br><br>

The IP tracking used by AutoRank Pro is different than that used by most competing software.  Most
other scripts keep a single IP log which is then used for all members.  What this means is that once an IP clicks through for one account,
it will not be able to click through for any other accounts.  Does that sound fair?  Well it didn't to us, so with AutoRank Pro it is possible for
a single IP address to give a hit to each account.

<br><br>

<b>Double CGI</b>

<br><br>

The next method is double CGI.  What this does is to create a gateway page on your server that surfers must click through in order for a
hit to be processed.  Using this will protect you from &lt;img&gt; tag cheaters.  For example, some cheaters will attempt to insert a link
to rankem.cgi in an image tag:

</font>

<pre>
&lt;img src="http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/top100/rankem.cgi?id=username"
height="1" width="1"&gt;
</pre>

<font face="Arial" size="2">

This will create an invisible image on the cheater's page, which will load the hit tracking script each time someone visits that page.
Without double CGI, the hits would be counted, and this account would go up in the rankings without even sending visitors to your site.
This type of cheat can be done with other type of HTML tags, so we highly recommend that all users enable double CGI.

<br><br>

<b>Gateway Sessions</b>

<br><br>

If you have double CGI enabled, the gateway page will keep track of sessions.  Each time the gateway page is displayed, a new, unique, session
will be generated.  You will be able to set the amount of time that session is
valid for.  Once a surfer has clicked on a link to your site, they will have x number of seconds to click on the gateway page link before
the session expires.  If the session expires before they click, the hit will not be counted.  If the session does not expire before
they click, the hit will be counted and the session will be deleted - no one else will be able to use that session.  We recommend that you
keep the expire time under 30 seconds.

<br><br>

Sessions assist double CGI to make sure that no HTML tag cheats are being used, and also make it more difficult for automated programs
to fool the system.  In previous versions, and most other top sites scripts, the HTTP_REFERER information is used to check that the surfer
is coming from a valid URL.  The problem with this is that the HTTP_REFERER value can be very easily spoofed, and the server will be tricked
into thinking the surfer came from a URL which they really did not.  This allows an automated program to circumvent the gateway page - with
sessions this is not possible.  A valid session must be created, and that can only be done by visiting the gateway page.

<br><br>

<b>Cookies</b>

<br><br>

Cookies are very similar to the IP tracking, but are not as reliable.  When someone clicks on a link to your site through rankem.cgi, a 
cookie will be set in their browser.  You will tell the software how long this cookie should last.  If the same browser is used to click
through again for the same account, the hit will not be counted.

<br><br>

Some of the drawbacks of cookies are the fact that they can be easily spoofed, they can be deleted easily, and not all browsers have cookies
enabled.  While this is the weakest of the cheat protection, it will still assist you in getting the most accurate hit count possible.  It 
is very quick to set and check cookies, so we recommend all users enable them.  Generally, expire times will be set to one day.

<br><br>

<b>Proxy Checking</b>

<br><br>

The first proxy checking method was added in v3.0.3p.  What this does is look at the HTTP headers sent with a request to determine if the
surfer is using a proxy to make the request.  If the headers are there, the hit is ignored.  Please note that this is not 100% effective
against proxy servers.  In our research we found that only about 60% of proxy servers send the extra HTTP headers that are required to determine
if it is a proxy server.  We will be continuing the effort to eliminate proxy cheating with further improvements in future versions.

<br><br>

Why block proxy servers?  Using proxy servers is a way that many automated hitbots will use to increase their hit count.  Using a different proxy
server for each hit will change the IP address of the hitbot, and the software will think that it is coming from a new user.  Because there are many
publicly accessible proxy servers, obtaining a large number of unique IP addresses is possible - hitbots can theoretically produce several thousand
false hits per day using public proxy servers.

<br><br>

What about valid proxy requests?  Some ISPs today do use proxy servers, which means that if you enable the proxy filtering some valid hits will
not be counted.  This is a side effect of the proxy filtering, but we feel that you would rather block out a few valid hits in order to protect
yourself from hundreds or thousands of invalid hits.  This may lower your overall total in hit count, but the distribution should be fairly even
over all of your members, thus giving a fair ranking result.

<br><br>

<b>JavaScript</b>

<br><br>

Another method of cheat prevention is a small piece of javascript on the gateway page.  If your copy of rankem.cgi is loaded into a frameset
on someones site, the code will immediately break out of the frameset and your gateway page will be the only thing visible.  In order for this
to work, you must have the gateway (double CGI) enabled.  If you create a custom version of the gateway, be sure to include the following body
tag in place of the one you would be using:

</font>

<pre>
&lt;body onLoad="if (self != top) top.location = self.location"&gt;
</pre>

<font face="Arial,Verdana" size="2">

You can add other attributes to this body tag, but make sure that the onLoad statement remains.

In this section we will discuss the entries you will find in the cheat log.

<br><br>

<b>Multiple Click - IP Add</b>

<br><br>

This cheat message indicates someone with the indicated IP clicked through more than one time for an account.  These cheat messages
will be reported when an IP address is found to have already clicked through for the specified account.

<br><br>

<b>Multiple Click - Cookie</b>

<br><br>

This cheat message indicates someone used the same browser to click through more than one time for an account.

<br><br>

<b>Using Proxy Server</b>

<br><br>

This message indicates that the user trying to send a hit was using a proxy server to make their request.  These cheat messages will
only appear if you have the proxy filtering option enabled.  In some of these messages you will find 2 IP addresses, with one in parenthesis.
The first IP address is the IP address of the proxy server, and the second one in parenthesis is the IP address that this request was
forwarded for.  This allows you to see the real IP address of the person making the request.  Please note that not all proxy servers will
provide the second IP, so some of these cheat messages will only contain the IP of the proxy server.

<br><br>

<b>Expired Gateway Session</b>

<br><br>

This message indicates that the surfer clicked on the gateway page link after the session had expired.  This is probably not something
to be worried about unless you see it happening many times for the same account.

<br><br>

<b>No Cookie Support</b>

<br><br>

If you are only allowing hits from cookie enabled browsers, this message indicates a browser was used which did not support cookies.

<br><br>

<b>Unsupported Browser</b>

<br><br>

This message indicates that the surfer is using a browser which is not supported by the software.  99% of todays browsers are supported, so
this will mostly filter out hitbots trying to send you bogus hits.
