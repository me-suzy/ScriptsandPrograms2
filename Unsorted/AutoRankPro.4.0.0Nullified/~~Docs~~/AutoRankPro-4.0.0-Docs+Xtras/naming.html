In this file, we will give you a quick overview of how to rename rankem.cgi and out.cgi.  Note that those are the
only two files which can be renamed - all others need to keep their default filename.

<br><br>

<b>The Basics</b>

<br><br>

Really, this is a very simple task.  All you need to do is decide on the name you want to give the files, then
rename the original files to their new names.  If you want rankem.cgi to be named in.cgi, just rename rankem.cgi to
in.cgi.  Once you have done that, you will need to update the In and Out URL fields in setup.cgi to reflect the
new names you have given the files.  After you have renamed or created a copy of rankem.cgi or out.cgi, make sure you
set the permissions on those files to 755 (Unix).

<br><br>

<b>If you already have members sending hits to rankem.cgi</b>

<br><br>

If you already have a few members who are sending hits to rankem.cgi, you will want to keep a copy of that script
on your server until all of your members have udpated their links with the new filename.  It is perfectly fine to
have several copies of rankem.cgi with different names.  Each one will track hits as normal, and they will share
the IP logs and gateway session information.

<br><br>

As an example, say you started out and got 10 members signed up.  They all got HTML code that linked them to rankem.cgi,
but now you want your members to link to in.cgi.  What you will do is make a copy of rankem.cgi and name it in.cgi.  Place
it in the same directory as rankem.cgi and make sure it is set to 755 for permissions (on Unix).  Now update setup.cgi so 
that the In URL field points to in.cgi.  From now on, all members that signup will get code that links them to in.cgi.  For
your other members, you can e-mail them and tell them of the new linking code.  The rankem.cgi script will continue to function
as long as you keep the file in place.

<br><br>

<b>Tips and Tricks</b>

<br><br>

On some servers, it is not necesary to name the file with a .cgi extension.  If you are running the software out of a cgi-bin
you may be able to name the files whatever you want.  You could, for example, rename 'rankem.cgi' to 'in'.  All of your members would then
be given code that would link them to:
</font>

<pre>http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/top100/in?id=username</pre>

<font face="Arial" size="2">

Before you start removing the .cgi file extension and telling your members to change their code, make sure this will work on your
server.  Not all servers allow this, and most only allow it inside the cgi-bin directory.

<br><br>

Giving the hit tracking scripts your own name allows you to brand the software to your site, and can often make your site look more
professional.  There are a lot of options, so give it a try.
