These upgrade instructions are for from AutoRank v2.1.x freeware only.  They will not work for older versions
of the software or the professional version.  You should allow at least 30 minutes to complete the upgrade.

<ol>

<li> Upload the autorank.cgi file from the v4.0.x distribution to the directory on your server where AutoRank is
currently installed.  Make sure you upload in ASCII mode and change the permissions on the file to 755.  You can now point
your browser to this file, and it will convert your member data.

<br><br>

<li> Now follow the instructions in the install.html documentation file.  Make sure you install AutoRank Pro into the directory
where AutoRank is currently located.  The only thing you will not need to do is create the data and template folders - those already
exist from your AutoRank installation.  All other steps of the installation should be followed.
