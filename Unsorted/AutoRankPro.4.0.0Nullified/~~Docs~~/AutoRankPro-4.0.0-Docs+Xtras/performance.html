If you are running a high traffic site, there are some things you can do to improve the performance of the software and make sure it stays
performing well.  We'll discuss those items in this file.

<br><br>

<b>Disable Search Engine, Quick List, and Random Link</b>

<br><br>

Yes, these are nice features to provide to your users, but they are all resource intensive.  The search and quick list are the worst offenders, so
those should be the first you disable.  All you need to do is remove the search.cgi and quick.cgi files from your server, and remove links to
them on your pages.  This will allow more of the server's resources to be dedicated to processing incoming and outoing hits.

<br><br>

<b>Clear the IP Log Often</b>

<br><br>

One thing that can take a lot of time to process is the IP logs.  If you are logging all IP addresses, it is highly recommended that you clean
them at least once every 24 hours.  This is done automatically, either through rankem.cgi or clean.cgi, depending on if you are using cron or not.

<br><br>

<b>Use Cron if it is Available</b>

<br><br>

If you have cron available on your server, using it can help to reduce the server load.  If the hit tracking script doesn't always have to check the
time, it will be more efficient.  If you understand how to setup cron, it is highly recommended that you use it.

<br><br>

<b>Categories</b>

<br><br>

The categories feature of AutoRank Pro can add significant processing time to the software if you are building seperate pages for each category.
Try to keep the number of categories to a minimum.  If you do have a lot of categories, you may want to disable the automatic reranking of category
pages and handle it manually.

<br><br>

<b>Members</b>

<br><br>

Keep track of your members.  Delete accounts that are no longer participating.  It takes time to process accounts even if they aren't sending hits,
so it will benefit you to remove inactive accounts.

<br><br>

<b>The Cheat and Error Logs</b>

<br><br>

If you never look at these, disable them.  If you do use them, be sure to clear them every few days.  You should try to keep them under 2.5 megs in size.
The cheat log is probably more important than the error log, so you can disable that one first if performance is a problem.

<br><br>

<b>Gateway Page HTML</b>

<br><br>

If you generate a customized gateway page, keep your HTML to a minimum.  The more HTML that the script has to write, the slower it is.  Only put the
items that are essential on that page.  If you add a lot of extras in your HTML, it can slow the software down.

<br><br>

<b>If You Don't Care About Cheating</b>

<br><br>

Yes, there are some top list administrators who don't care about cheaters.  If that is you, disable all of the cheat protection features.  This will
improve the performance of rankem.cgi and allow you to track more hits per day using fewer resources.

The C add on available for AutoRank Pro can greatly influence the performance of the software.  This add on is available for a small
fee, and are fairly easy to install.  Complete details on this add on can be found <a href="/software/arp/addons.php">here</a>.
