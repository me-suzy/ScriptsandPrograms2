There is certain HTML which must appear on the gateway page.  The current version of the software uses a form to process all
of the incoming hits.  This means you cannot use a standard HTML link for your surfers to click on.   The required portion
of the gateway is listed below.

</font>

<xmp>
<form name="click" action="#%URL%#" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="ses" value="#%SESSION%#">
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="#%USERNAME%#">
<script language="JavaScript">
 <!--
 document.write('<a href="javascript:document.click.submit()">Enter This Site</a>');
 //-->
</script>
<noscript>
<input type="submit" value="Click Here To Enter">
</noscript>
</form>
</xmp>

<font face="Arial" size="2">

You can change the "Click Here To Enter" and "Enter This Site" text, but all of the other items must remain unchanged.  The above
code will produce a text link for browsers which support JavaScript and a submit button for those which do not.  You need to leave
both of these options so that all surfers can click into your site.

The rest of the HTML is completely up to you.  We do recommend that you use as little HTML as possible in order to maintain the performance
of the software.  The more HTML it has to process, the slower it will be.

<br><br>

Once you have generated a custom version of the gateway through the administrative interface, you are not finished.  A copy of rankem.cgi will
be placed in the data directory - this will be the new version of rankem.cgi with your gateway HTML.  Until you replace your old copy of rankem.cgi
with this new one, your gateway will not be updated.

<br><br>

The easiest way to replace your old copy of rankem.cgi with the new one is with the following steps.

<br>

<ol>

<li> FTP into your server and change into the data directory of the AutoRank Pro installation.  Locate the rankem.cgi file and download it to your computer
     in ASCII mode.

     <Br><br>

<li> In your FTP client change into the main AutoRank Pro installation directory where the old rankem.cgi file is located.  Do <i>not</i> delete this file!
     Simply upload the new rankem.cgi file to that directory in ASCII mode.  If you are asked if you want to replace the current rankem.cgi file, select yes.
     Double check to make sure the rankem.cgi file has 755 permissions.

     <br><br>

<li> Finally, you will want to visit rankem.cgi in your browser to check the new gateway.

</ol>
