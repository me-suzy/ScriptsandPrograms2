AutoRank Professional  

Notice: To avoid confusion with the 3.0.5 release, version 3.5.0 of AutoRank
Pro has been given a new version number. It is now know as version 4.0.0.
There have been no changes except for the version number. If you are using 3.5.0, 
you do not need to update any files on your server. If you want the 4.0.0 version 
to display in your administrative interface, you only need to update the arp.pl 
file on your server.
