<P><i>*If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may copy and paste your configuration variables into the new classifieds.cgi file, upload it, and chmod 755. You will also need to upload index.txt as it has changed also. Always backup your  scripts before making any changes. An easy way to do this is to rename your old script classifieds.cgi.BAK.cgi</i>
<H3><A name=Requirements>Requirements</A></H3>
<UL type=1>
  <LI>A website with access to a CGI directory. 
  <LI>Perl 5.003 or higher. 
  <LI>A FTP uploading utility that allows you to select ASCII or binary mode. If 
  you do not already have an FTP utility you might try <A 
  href="http://www.ipswitch.com/">WS-FTP</A> or <A 
  href="http://www.cuteftp.com/">CuteFTP</A>. </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=Directories>Creating Directories</A></H3>
<UL type=1>
  <LI>Make a directory on your server where the data will be stored. For 
  security reasons it is best to make this folder in a directory that it isn't 
  web accessable. If you do not have access to a directory that is not web 
  accessable, you should use .htacess and .htpasswd files to protect the data 
  from being seen by visitors (contact your web host for more information about 
  password protection on your server). You should also upload an index.html file 
  to this directory if it is web accessable. If you are on a Unix server, chmod 
  the folder to 777. If you are using NT, give this folder full rights.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Within the directory that you just created, make a directory named 
  <I>bannedmail</I>. Chmod this directory to 777 (or give full rights on 
  NT).</LI><br><br>
<LI>Create a directory where uploaded images will be stored. Chmod this directory to 777 (or give full rights on 
  NT). This directory does not have to be in your CGI directory and if your web host does not allow images in the CGI directory you will want to make this directory under your public html directory.</UL>
<H3><A name=Variables>Configuring Script Variables</A></H3>Open classifieds.cgi 
with a text editor such as WordPad. 
<P>The first line of classifieds.cgi is the path to Perl. Change this to the 
path to Perl on your server. Be sure that this line starts with <I>#!</I>. 
Contact your web host if you do not know the path to Perl on your server. 
<P>In the configuration section of classifieds.cgi (below the copyright notice) 
you will need to set the following variables: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DT>$config{'basepath'} 
  <DD>The path of the data directory you created. Be sure to include the 
  trailing slash. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'closedir'} 
  <DD>The name of the directory for storing expired ads. This will allow you to 
  keeps ads for records and also allows users to repost their ads when they 
  receive an ad expiration e-mail. There is no need to create this directory, 
  the script will create it when run. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'regdir'} 
  <DD>The name of the directory for storing users' registration files. There is 
  no need to create this directory, the script will create it when run. You may 
  also choose not to require registration by setting this variable to 
  <I>$config{'regdir'} = '';</I>. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'adminpass'} 
  <DD>The password for accessing the administrative functions. You should change

  these variables and comment the other line out by placing a <I>#</I> at the 
  beginning of the line. It is preferable to use a mail program and this is 
  possible with nearly all web hosts. Contact your web host for the path to your 
  mail program. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'admin_address'} 
  <DD>The e-mail address where you would like to receive administrative mail 
  such as new user registration and new ad listing notifications. It is also the 
  address that will be listed on the e-mails that are sent to users. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'scripturl'} 
  <DD>Your website address. This is not the address to your script. Do not

  <DD>The color of the table body. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'colortableborder'}

  (i.e, Jim\'s). 
  <P></P>

  <DD>The number of titles to display on each ad listing page. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'searchpagebreak'}

  <DD>The number of ads each user is allowed to post. This does not include 
  expired ads. 
  <P></P>

  href="#HTML">HTML 
  Customization</A> section for additional tips for customizing your script. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'footer'} 
  <DD>The HTML code that will be appended to the bottom of your script. Be sure 
  to leave <I>&lt;&lt;"EOF";</I> intact. Also be sure to include the <I>BODY</I> 
  and <I>HTML</I> tags as wells as the <I>EOF</I> at the end of your HTML. See 
  the <A 
  href="#HTML">HTML 
  Customization</A> section for additional tips for customizing your script. 
  </DD></DL>
<P>To configure the ad duration choices a user has, search for <I>&lt;select 
name=DAYS size="1"&gt;</I> in the script. After this you will see the options 
for ad duration. You may change these to any amount of time you like. The values 
are equal to the amount of days (1 week = 7 days). 
<P>If you would like to allow users to place an ad for longer than one year you 
will also need to search for <I>366</I> in the script and change this number to 
1 above the number of days you would like to allow the user to place the ad. For 
example, if you would like users to be able to place an ad for 2 years you would 
change this number to 731 (365 days * 2 + 1). 

<P>Open upload.cgi and change the first line to reflect your server's path to perl.

<P>In the configuration section of upload.cgi you will need to set the following variables:

  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'basedir'} 
  <DD>This is the path to your uploaded image directory. This should be the same as <i>$config{'imageuploaddir'}</i> in classifieds.cgi.

<P></P>
  <DT>$config{'basedir'} 
  <DD>The URL to your uploaded image directory. 

  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'windows'}
  <DD>This one is easy :)  If you are on a Windows server enter "yes", if not enter "no". This will automatically chmod the image for you if you are on a Unix server.


  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'returnurl'}
  <DD>The full URL to your classifieds script.


  <P></P>
  <DT>$config{'mailerror'}
  <DD>The e-mail address of the site administrator.



<H3><A name=Upload>Uploading Files</A></H3>
<UL type=1>
  <LI>Upload classifieds.cgi and upload.cgi to your CGI directory. Be sure to upload in ASCII 
  mode. Chmod these files to 755.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Upload index.txt to the CGI directory where you uploaded classifieds.cgi. 
  Be sure to upload in ASCII mode. If you changed the name of classifieds.cgi, 
  you will need tochange <I>my $configfile</I> in index.txt to the name of your 
  classifieds script.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Upload camera.gif to your CGI directory. You must use binary mode to 
  upload this file. If your web host does not allow images in the CGI directory, 
  you may upload this file to your images directory. If you upload this file to 
  your image directory or another directory you must edit the classifieds.cgi 
  file. Simply use the find function in your text editor and search for 
  <I>camera.gif</I>, then add the url or path to this file before 
  <I>camera.gif</I>. </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=Script>Calling the Script</A></H3>To access the script go 
to:<BR><I>http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-directory/classifieds.cgi</I>.<BR><BR>To 
access the administration panel go 
to:<BR><I>http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-directory/classifieds.cgi?action=adminview</I>.<BR><BR>*Be 
sure to replace <I>www.yourdomain.com</I> with your domain name or address and 
change <I>cgi-directory</I> to the name of your CGI directory. 
<H3><A name=Troubleshooting>Troubleshooting Errors</A></H3><B>500 Internal 
Server Error: Possible Causes</B> 
<UL type=1>
  <LI>The script was not uploaded in ASCII mode. 
  <LI>The script was not chmod 755. 
  <LI>The path to perl is not correct. 
  <LI>There is a syntax error caused by a bad text editor or mistakes made while 
  editing the script. 
  <LI>The server has an older version of Perl than 5.003.</LI></UL>
<P><B>The ad number must consist of alphanumeric characters only.</B> - The 
trailing slash is wrong. Try placing the trailing slash like this / at the start 
and the end of the basepath. Sometimes this is necessary even when using a 
Windows server. 
<P><B>Category directory could not be opened.</B> - The basepath is incorrect. 
If you do not know the path to your site, you will need to ask your web host. 
The basepath will be the path to your site including the path from your site to 
your data directory. 
<H3><A name=HTML>HTML Customization</A></H3>It is always advisable to make a 
backup copy of your script before you make any modifications or changes to the 
script or the HTML within the script. 
<P>CodeGirl Classifieds is built upon table percentages instead of pixels (with 
exception of the admin sections - you can modify those sections) and will easily 
fit anywhere in your page that you desire. The easiest way to use your HTML is 
to use a standard header and footer. You can easily create a professional 
looking page by inserting CodeGirl Classifieds into a table also. 
<P>If you are customizing your classifieds page beyond a typical header and 
footer, the best way to determine how to configure the <I>$config{'header'}</I> 
and <I>$config{'footer'}</I> is to design your site with a blank space or table 
where you want the classifieds to appear. Once you have determined where you 
want the classifieds to appear, insert a comment line for a marker such as 
<I>INSERT CLASSIFIEDS HERE</I>. It will then be very easy to determine which 
part of your HTML should be your head and which should be your footer. 
Everything above your comment line will be your header (including the <I>HTML, 
HEAD, TITLE,</I> and <I>BODY</I> tags). Everything below your comment line will 
be your footer (including the ending <I>BODY</I> and <I>HTML</I> tags). 
<P>You may also change your category pages to be HTML pages instead of the 
script generated category pages. To do this you simply would link your 
categories to the corresponding categories of your script. If you do this, 
remember to change the link for <I>Categories</I> at the bottom of your page to 
the HTML page of your categories. 
<P>Fonts are easily changed within the script. You can either set a 
<I>BASEFONT</I> tag for the entire page in your header or you can change the 
font for each line of the script that is printed to the screen. 
<H3><A name=Support>Support</A></H3>Unlimited technical support is offered from 
30 days of product delivery date. Technical support covers the functionality of 
the script and does not include custom modifications. Custom modifications are 
provided at a rate of $30/hr. At the end of the 30 day period we will attempt to 
give technical assistance as time permits and as long as the offer of continued 
support is not abused.
