INSTALLATION:
=============

calpublisher.cgi/monthly.cgi/daily.cgi:

1) Defined the path to Perl at the first line of the 3 scripts
   (default is #!/usr/bin/perl).
2) Create a folder "calpublisher" under the cgi bin (leave it
   at the default chmod value). This will be:
    www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/calpublisher/
3) Set the variables in the 3 scripts.
4) Upload all the 3 ***.cgi scripts to the "calpublisher" folder
   above and chmod all the 3 scripts to 755.
5) Create a sub-folder "data" under the "calpublisher" folder
   and chmod to 777. In some servers, you need to leave it at 755.
   This will be:
    www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/calpublisher/data
6) Create a folder "calpublisher" under the ROOT directory. This
   will be:
    www.yourdomain.com/calpublisher/
7) Create a sub-folder "icons" under this "calpublisher" folder.
   This will be:
    www.yourdomain.com/calpublisher/icons
8) Upload the data file "data.txt" to the sub-folder "data" and
   chmod to 777.
9) Upload all the images to the sub-folder "icons".
