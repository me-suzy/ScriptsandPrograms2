SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The script was tested on 21stcenturyhost.net's virtual servers
(http://www.21stcenturyhost.net). In order to run the script,
the following is required:
- UNIX-based server (script was not tested on Win NT/2000, but some users were able to install it on Win 2000);
- Perl 5 or later;
- Capability to execute Perl scripts and set permissions on the server;
- UNIX sendmail is required in order to use e-mail features.



INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


1. Unzip all the script files to a temporary directory.


2. Choose or create a directory on your server where you want to install the script
(e.g. "/cgi-bin/stories").


3. Set up the permissions on this newly created directory as shown below:

CHMOD 755 stories


4. Create another 4 directories within your script directory: "/flags", "/members", "/templates" and "/text".
Your directory tree should look something like this:

/cgi-bin
----/stories
--------/flags
--------/members
--------/templates
--------/text

***This directory structure is recommended but is not required. You can place the "/flags", "/members",
"/templates" and "/text" directories anywhere on your server.***


5. Set up the permissions on your directories as shown below:

CHMOD 755 flags
CHMOD 777 members
CHMOD 777 templates
CHMOD 777 text


6. Upload the contents of the supplied "flags" folder to your "/flags" directory created in step 4.
***All graphic files must be uploaded in BINARY MODE***


7. Upload the contents of the supplied "members" folder to your "/members" directory created in step 4. Set up the permissions:

CHMOD 777 deleted.cgi
CHMOD 777 memblist.cgi

***All CGI files must be uploaded in ASCII MODE***


8. Upload the contents of the supplied "templates" folder to your "/templates" directory created in step 4. Set up the permissions:

CHMOD 777 common.txt
CHMOD 777 errors.tmpl
CHMOD 777 foot.txt
CHMOD 777 head.txt
CHMOD 777 index.tmpl
CHMOD 777 membarea.tmpl
CHMOD 777 memblogin.tmpl
CHMOD 777 membprofile.tmpl
CHMOD 777 regform.tmpl
CHMOD 777 regterms.tmpl
CHMOD 777 story.tmpl
CHMOD 777 substory.tmpl
CHMOD 777 success.tmpl

***All text and template files must be uploaded in ASCII MODE***


9. Upload the contents of the supplied "text" folder to your "/text" directory created in step 4. Set up the permissions:

CHMOD 777 authors.cgi
CHMOD 777 content.cgi
CHMOD 777 count.txt
CHMOD 777 gcount.txt
CHMOD 777 genres.cgi
CHMOD 777 rcount.txt
CHMOD 777 stories.cgi

***All CGI and text files must be uploaded in ASCII MODE***


10. Upload the program files to the script directory created in step 2 (e.g. "cgi-bin/stories"). Set up the permissions:

CHMOD 777 adminpass.cgi
CHMOD 777 common.sub
CHMOD 777 content.sub
CHMOD 777 genres.sub
CHMOD 777 memb.sub
CHMOD 777 settings.cgi
CHMOD 777 stories.sub
CHMOD 777 templates.sub
CHMOD 777 variables.sub

CHMOD 755 admin.cgi
CHMOD 755 index.cgi
CHMOD 755 members.cgi
CHMOD 755 post.cgi
CHMOD 755 profile.cgi
CHMOD 755 story.cgi

***All program files must be uploaded in ASCII MODE***


11. Type in the URL of your admin.cgi file in your browser location window (e.g. "http://www.mywebsite.com/cgi-bin/stories/admin.cgi").
You should see the Interactive Fiction Admin Menu.
***If you receive an "500-Internal Server Error", check all permissions and make sure that all program files were uploaded in ASCII mode***
***"404-File Not Found Error" means that you typed in an incorrect URL***


12. The default administrative password is admin - it will be set the first time you run the admin.cgi script. You can change it by
choosing the "Change Administrative Password" option from the Interactive Fiction Admin Menu.


13. Now click the "Configure Script Variables" link on the Interactive Fiction Admin Menu and adjust the script variables as required.


14. Click the "My Interactive Fiction" link on the Interactive Fiction Admin Screen, register and post a new story.


15. You may now explore other options on the administrative menu. Please see our Interactive Fiction FAQ at
http://scripts.21stcenturyhost.net/if/faq.htm for more information.


COMMON PROBLEMS:

(i) The script displays broken images. SOLUTION: Move the supplied "flags" folder outside your cgi-bin and modify the script variables
accordingly. Some servers do not allow images to be displayed under "cgi-bin" directory.

(ii) The script gives an error "Incorrect Paths". SOLUTION: If you are not sure about your paths, contact your system administrator.

(iii) Script generates 500 Internal Server Error. SOLUTION: Refer to installation instructions above and double check permissions on
all files. Check the perl path at the top of each .cgi file and make sure it works for your server. Also check if the files are in 
correct locations and if they were uploaded in correct mode (ASCII/BINARY).



OTHER NOTES

Every feature of the script has been tested, however bugs can pop up out of nowhere sometimes. If you ever come across any
irregularities or errors when running a script, please let us know by visiting our forums.
