Upgrading from e_Match 2.0

1.) e_MAtch 3.0 stores user files in a directory outside of you web space, if the appropriate path is set.  This is to eliminate the possibility ofa hacker finding the user.log, and thereby finding a user's personal files.  This isn't very likely to occur with 2.0, but 3.0 makes it even less likely.  However, if you have too many user files and you don't want to relocate them, just leave them where they are, and set $datapath and $htmlpath equal to the old $datapath.  This is not as secure as the new setup, although I've receive no reports of any problems with the old setup.

2.) You'll need to replace all of your .cgi files, and add the new scripts.  You'll also need to relocate your form files (subject text, object.txt, and interest.txt.), your disclaimer.html, your style.css, and your banner.gif, if you use them.  Use the readme as a guide to what goes where.
