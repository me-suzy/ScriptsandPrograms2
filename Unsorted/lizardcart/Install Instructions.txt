INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
First you must change the variables in the "config.inc.php" and "admin/config.inc.php" files
to the correct information needed to access the MySQL database you just created and the other
configuration variables. Next you will need to open the "admin/atho.inc.php" file and change
the current username and password to whatever you choose.

You can now upload all files and associated directories to a folder called "lizardcart" or
directly into your websites main directory (both ways should work fine). Next, create a
MySQL Database, after you have finished doing that you will now want to run the "install.php"
file from wherever it is located on your server and follow the instructions.

To login to the admin area go to "http://www.yoursite.com/admin/index.php" or wherever you
installed the script and login using the information you enterd in the "atho.inc.php" file.
To config the shopping cart logic open the "nopcart.js" file in "WordPad" which should have
came with your computer.

This concludes the installation; enjoy!
