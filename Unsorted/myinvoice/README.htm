<p><b>Intro:</b></p>
<p> If you want to use this program on a website you can for free, but leave the
  copyright notice that is commented in the code.
  . And don`t forget to rate the script on www.hotscripts.com!</p>
<p><b><a name="1"></a>Requirements:</b></p>
<p>You will need a webserver which has installed PHP 4, and mySQL version 3.2
  upwards.</p>
<p><b><a name="2"></a>Installation:</b></p>
<p>1. Unzip the.php, .htm and .css files and place them on your webserver (or
  locally, as you will have to make some changes and then upload) in a directory
  called myinvoice (or whatever). All the files can be left in the same directory
  structure, but if you want to move config.php feel free.</p>
<p>2. Open <b>config.php</b> and change the variables to your server specification,
  and change the details to your company address, name, and other bits and pieces,
  including if you want auto emails sent to clients upon receipt of payment.</p>
<p>3. You need to create the tables clients and invoices in your mySQL database.
  (Dont alter the table names unless you want to go through each line of code
  changing the relevant parts) Either via telnet,
  or <a href="http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net">phpMyAdmin</a> enter the information
  stored in <b>clients.sql </b>and<b> invoices.sql</b>. You can create a separate
  database for the system if you like, it`s up to you.</p>
<p>4. Go in as administrator (admin: admin) and change the password from admin
  to something else.</p>
<p>5. Enter client profiles, including email, client code, and client name. Inform
  the client of their username and password, so that they can view their invoices</p>
<p>6. And enter the invoices (!)</p>
<p></p>
<p>That`s it!</p>
