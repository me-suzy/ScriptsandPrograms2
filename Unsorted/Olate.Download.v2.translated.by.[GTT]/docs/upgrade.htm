<td><p>Upgrading to Olate Download v2.2 is very straightforward and can be completed in only a few minutes. Follow the instructions below to install the script onto your website.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>In order to use Olate Download, you will need the following available on your server:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 4.1.0+</li>
<li>MySQL Available </li>
</ul>
<p>The setup script will detect whether you have the correct requirements available. Olate Download has been tested on Linux (Apache) and Windows (IIS/Apache) with no problems. However, it can't be tested on all versions of the servers/operating systems. If you spot a problem with installation or running of the script, please post on the <a href="http://www.olate.com/forums" target="_blank">Olate Forums</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Installation Instructions</strong></p>
<p><u>1. Upload files </u></p>
<p>Upload all of the files contained within the /html directory ensuring that you maintain the original directory structure and filenames overwriting all of your existing files. You may with to keep your css/ directory as no updates have been made to the css file and you will therefore be able to retain any changes you have made to it. </p>

</tr>
</table>
<p><u>2. chmod 777 includes/db.php </u></p>
<p>In order to allow the setup script to write to includes/db.php, you need to chmod it to 777. This can usually be done via your FTP client by right clicking the file and selecting Properties or by using the chmod 777 db.php command via SSH access. </p>
<p><u>3. Load setup script </u></p>
<p>Open the setup script in your browser by browsing to the directory you uploaded the script to and then adding /setup to the end. For example, if you uploaded to www.yourdomain.com/downloads then browse to www.yourdomain.com/downloads/setup. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. </p>
<p>For instructions on how to use the system, please refer to the <a href="manual.htm">Manual</a>. </p>
