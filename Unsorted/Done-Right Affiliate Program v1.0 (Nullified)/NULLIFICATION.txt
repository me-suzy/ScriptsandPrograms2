 Done-Right Affiliate Program v1.0
 ---------------------------------

       Supplied by Scoons

        Nullified by TNO

      Distributed via xCGI

 ---------------------------------



 Nullification Information
 -------------------------
 
 3x images being called from the vendors server have been
 downloaded to the image directory within the distro and
 will now be called locally. Please see section 3a and 3b
 part 1b, 1c respectively in the "README.txt".

 All links back to vendor have been completely removed. In
 the admin section "Download", "Support", "Feedback" and
 "Order Addons" have all been disabled along with all relevant
 chunks of code. As a warez user you have no need for these
 functions, and they were just slowing down the script.
 This major code chop prevents call home and also prevents the
 auto update which would "chomp" at your password in unlicensed
 versions, thus locking you out of your administration panel.



 Installation Information
 ------------------------
 
 See "README.txt", but please make note of the sections I have
 added regarding the downloaded images. Once installed you may
 enter anything you like as your registration code but bear in
 mind it doubles as your administrator password. Not that it
 matters too much because you can change this later on anyway.
