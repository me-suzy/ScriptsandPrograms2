welcome to <b>EZAUCTGN</b><img src="new_tiny.gif">&nbsp - the Easy Auction Site Generator.  
&nbsp;without a doubt, the most popular online auction script on the net today is EveryAuction
from <a href="http://www.everysoft.com/auction">EverySoft</a>.  Since its introduction in 1997, 
EveryAuction has consistently proven to be the best free online auction software package.
<p>i've written <b>ezauctgn.pl</b> to generate auction sites and modified EveryAuction 1.5 
(renamed as <b>ezauct.pl</b>) to serve as the auction engine for EZAUCTGN.
<p>after you install this script at your site, you offer your guests the ability to 
create their own Auction Sites.  Each auction site can be tailored and the owner may
specify the following:
<ul>
<li>choose the color scheme for the auction site
<li>define the directory where closed auctions will be moved
<li>define the directory where registration information is kept
<li>define "sniper" protection period (how many minutes past the last bid to hold auction).
<li>allow users to post items
<li>select file locking
<li>select the categories to include in the auction
</ul>
<p>the auction requires all bidders and sellers to register with a unique userid and 
password which is mailed to the user so valid email id's are needed for registration.
<p>functions for deleting auction items and categories are available from the Edit button.
<p>you may now download <a href="http://www.inet-images.com/manny/ezauctgn.zip">
ezauctgn.zip</a> which
includes all the files needed for installation.&nbsp;
