  <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
  <p><em>Editize</em> is a simple product with complex technology behind it. As 
    such, there are a number of little things that have to be set up 'just right' 
    for it to function correctly. In this section, we'll tackle some of the most 
    frequently encountered problems along with their solutions.</p>
  <p>Feel free to contact <a href="http://editize.com/support.php">Customer Support</a> 
    if you are unable to resolve your problem with the instructions provided here.</p>
  <h2>General Java Applet Errors</h2>
  <p><strong>The License File for Editize in this Web page is not found.</strong></p>
  <p>If the <em>Editize </em>applet displays a message box with this error message, 
    it means the Java Plug-In was not able to download the license file for your 
    Web site. This file should generally be called <code>editize.<em>hostname</em>.lic</code>, 
    where <code><em>hostname</em></code> is the hostname of your Web site, and 
    should be placed in the same publically-accessible (i.e. not password-protected) 
    directory of your Web site as <code>editize.jar</code>.</p>
  <p>Assuming you have placed this file where it belongs, it is possible that 
    your organization's proxy server is interfering with the Java Plug-in's ability 
    to download the license file. This usually occurs when a Microsoft Proxy Server 
    (ISA) is in use. Microsoft Proxy Server uses a non-standard user authentication 
    method called NTLM (a.k.a. challenge-response) that the Java Plug-in does 
    not yet support (Java 1.4.2, to be released early in 2003, is slated to support 
    it).</p>
  <p>One possible work-around to the Microsoft Proxy Server issue is to instruct 
    the Java Plug-in not to use your proxy server. To do this, uncheck the &quot;Use 
    browser settings&quot; option on the &quot;Proxies&quot; page of the Java 
    Plug-In applet in your Windows Control Panel. If your organization's network 
    does not permit access to the Web without passing through the Proxy Server, 
    this work-around will not work.</p>
  <p><strong>java.lang.ClassFormatError: com/editize/EditizeApplet (bad magic 
    number)</strong></p>
  <p>The this error indicates that the Java Plug-In tried to download the <code>editize.jar</code> 
    file but instead your Web server sent it something else (e.g. a custom 404 
    error page). Usually this will happen if you have not correctly set the <code>codebase</code> 
    property of the Editize API you are using.</p>
  <p>Try typing the URL for <code>editize.jar</code> on your server into your 
    Web browser. Does it download correctly? If so, try running <em>Editize</em> 
    again. When the error occurs, open the Java Console in your browser (double-click 
    the Java icon in the Windows System Tray) and look for a more technically 
    detailed error message. A URL in the error message should indicate where the 
    Java Plug-In is trying to download <code>editize.jar</code> from. Adjust the 
    <code>codebase</code> property of your selected API to make sure this is pointing 
    to the actual location of the <code>editize.jar</code> file.</p>
  <p><strong>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.editize.EditizeApplet</strong></p>
  <p>The this error indicates that the Java Plug-In tried to download the <code>editize.jar</code> 
    file but was unable to do so for some reason. Possible causes of this problem 
    include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have not correctly set the <code>codebase</code> property of the Editize 
      API you are using.</li>
    <li><code>editize.jar</code> is not in the correct location on your server.</li>
    <li><code>editize.jar</code> is in a directory that is protected by a password.</li>
    <li>Your organization's firewall prevents the Java Plug-In from downloading 
      <code>editize.jar</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Try typing the URL for <code>editize.jar</code> on your server into your 
    Web browser. Does it download correctly? If so, try running <em>Editize</em> 
    again. When the error occurs, open the Java Console in your browser (double-click 
    the Java icon in the Windows System Tray) and look for a more technically 
    detailed error message. A URL in the error message should indicate where the 
    Java Plug-In is trying to download <code>editize.jar</code> from (the error 
    will probably make it look like it's trying to download <code>com/editize/EditizeApplet.class</code>, 
    but this actually the fallback that the plug-in tries when it fails to retrieve 
    <code>editize.jar</code> from the same location. Adjust the <code>codebase</code> 
    property of your selected API to make sure this is pointing to the actual 
    location of the <code>editize.jar</code> file.</p>
  <p><strong>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sitepoint.rapidapps.rapidedit.RapidEditApplet</strong></p>
  <p>The class name for the <em>Editize </em>applet was changed as of <em>Editize</em> 
    2.0 to <code>com.editize.EditizeApplet</code>. If you get an error message 
    with 'rapidedit' in it, this means you're using an outdated version of your 
    selected <em>Editize </em>API (<code>editize.php</code>, <code>editizedotnet.dll</code>, 
    <code>editize.wsc</code>, or <code>editize.js</code>). Replace the version 
    of the <em>Editize </em>API on your server with the one that came with the 
    version of <em>Editize </em>that you wish to use.</p>
  <h2>International Character Sets</h2>
  <p><strong>When my users try to input Chinese or other non-Latin characters 
    into an <em>Editize</em>, all they see are little boxes where the characters 
    should be.</strong></p>
  <p>As a Java applet, <em>Editize</em> fully supports international (including 
    double byte) character sets. The source of the problem here is that <em>Editize</em> 
    uses &quot;Times New Roman&quot; as its default font, which does not contain 
    characters for Chinese text.</p>
  <p>Try setting the <code>basefontface</code> property of your selected API to 
    a font that you know contains the required characters. If <em>Editize </em>still 
    doesn't display the text correctly, please contact our <a href="http://editize.com/support.php">Customer 
    Support</a> department so we can help diagnose the problem.</p>
  <h2>The ASP API</h2>
  <p><strong>I get an error message when I try to register or use the Editize 
    API for ASP (<code>editize.wsc</code>).</strong></p>
  <p>In all likelihood, you need to update the version of Microsoft Windows Script 
    installed on your server. As of this writing, the latest version is 5.6, and 
    may be <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/733/msdncompositedoc.xml">downloaded 
    for free</a> from Microsoft.</p>
  <p>Another possibility is that you have placed the <code>editize.wsc</code> 
    file on a mapped network drive. Windows Script Components must always be placed 
    on a local drive, and you'll get a fairly ugly and nondescript ASP error message 
    if you try to use one that isn't.</p>
  <h2>The JavaScript API</h2>
  <p><strong>I keep getting JavaScript errors when I try to use the <em>Editize</em> 
    API for JavaScript to edit an existing document.</strong></p>
  <p>JavaScript does not like apostrophes (<code>'</code>) or line breaks to appear 
    within a string. Since both of these characters may appear in an HTML document 
    that you supply for <em>Editize</em> to edit, you need to replace them with 
    special character codes to prevent JavaScript errors from occurring. Apostrophes 
    must be escaped with backslashes (<code>\'</code>) and each line break must 
    be replaced with <code>\n</code>.</p>
  <p>See the index.php and Default.asp sample scripts in the javascript folder 
    of the Editize distribution for examples of how these special characters may 
    be replaced in PHP and ASP, respectively. Similar techniques may be applied 
    in most any other server-side language.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="cfhowto"></a>Can the JavaScript API for Editize be used 
    with ColdFusion?</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely! You just need to take care of the special characters, as discussed 
    under the previous heading.</p>
  <p>Here's a little 'how-to' that one of our users provided on how to get <em>Editize 
    </em>working in a ColdFusion Web site while avoiding the special character 
    issues: </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Here's how to modify the <code>tripedit.cfm</code> file, which is part 
      of the Cold Fusion MX &quot;Compass Travel Trip Maintenance&quot; example 
      script, to use <em>Editize</em> instead of a plain text area: </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Add the include for the <code>editize.js</code> file
    <pre>&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; src=&quot;editize.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></li>
  <li>Insert a new form called &quot;hiddenForm&quot; before the existing form
  <pre>&lt;cfform action=&quot;&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; NAME=&quot;hiddenForm&quot;&gt; 
&lt;cfoutput&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;tripDesc&quot; 
value=&quot;#HTMLEditFormat(tripDescription,1)#&quot;&gt;&lt;/cfoutput&gt; 
&lt;/cfform&gt;</pre></li>
  <li>Change the code in the <code>&lt;!--- Field: tripDescription ---&gt;</code> section
  <p>From: </p>
  <pre>&lt;cfinput size=&quot;50&quot; maxlength=250 required=&quot;Yes&quot; name=&quot;tripDescription&quot; 
value=#tripDescription#&gt;</pre>
  <p>To: </p>
        <pre>&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var ed = new Editize();
ed.name = 'tripDescription';
ed.basefontface = 'Verdana';
ed.basefontsize = '12';
ed.height = 120;
ed.width = 600;
ed.linkurls[0] = 'mailto:';
ed.linkurls[1] = 'http://www.mysite.com/';
var temp = document.hiddenForm.tripDesc.value;
ed.display(temp);
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      </li>
  <li>Save the tripedit.cfm file.</li>
  <li>Run the tripsearch.cfm page.</li>
  <li>Select a trip from tripsearchresult.cfm page.</li>
  <li>Click the Edit button on the tripdetail.cfm page.</li>
  <li>The &quot;Editized&quot; tripedit.cfm page appears.</li>
  <li>Make any changes, and click the Save button.</li>
  <li>The changes appear in the tripdetail.cfm page.</li>
  <li>Reedit if needed.</li></ol></blockquote>
  <p>As you can see, the trick this user came up with was to use a hidden form 
    field to write the document to, then grab the contents of that field with 
    JavaScript. Since the code of the document doesn't appear in any actual JavaScript 
    code, the special character issues are therefore avoided.</p>
