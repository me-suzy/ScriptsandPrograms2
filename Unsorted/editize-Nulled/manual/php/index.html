<h1>The Editize&#8482; API for PHP</h1>
  <p> This section of the manual explains in detail how to add an <em>Editize</em> 
    field to a form on a PHP-equipped Web site.</p>
  <p>Before integrating <em>Editize </em>into your Content Management System (CMS), 
    you should first install it on your Web server and try out one or more of 
    the sample scripts. Once you have verified that the samples work, you can 
    proceed to use <em>Editize</em> anywhere you like on your site.</p>
  <h2>Step 1: Put the <em>Editize</em> files on your server</h2>
  <p>Your first step should be to copy or upload the contents of the <code>php</code> 
    folder of the <em>Editize</em> distribution to a folder on your Web server. 
    If you use your own computer as a Web server for development purposes, copy 
    the files in the <code>php</code> folder to a folder in your Web root.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Example 1: Uploading to your Web Host</strong><br>
      If your Web site is hosted by a Web hosting company, use your FTP program 
      (or whatever method you normally use to place files on your Web site) to 
      create a folder called <code>editize</code> in the root of your site. A 
      file in this directory should be accessible with a URL such as <code>http://www.yoursite.com/editize/filename</code>. 
      Upload all of the files in the <code>php</code> folder of the <em>Editize</em> 
      distributon to this new folder on your Website.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2: Installing on your local test server<br>
      </strong> If you use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) as a Web 
      server on your Windows computer, the Web root folder is <code>C:\Inetpub\wwwroot</code> 
      by default. If you use Apache, the Web root folder is <code>C:\Apache\htdocs</code> 
      by default. Crate a new folder called <code>editize</code> in your Web root 
      folder. Copy all of the files in the <code>php</code> folder of the <em>Editize</em> 
      distribution to this new folder on your Website.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The folder where you place the <em>Editize</em> files on your server must 
    not be password protected. None of these files is a security risk, so you 
    don't need to worry about them being publically accessible.</p>
  <p>Here's a list of the files in the <code>php</code> folder with an explanation 
    of what each one does:</p>
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" id="filelist">
    <tr> 
      <td><code>editize.jar</code></td>
      <td>The <em>Editize</em> Java library file. This contains the <em>Editize 
        </em>applet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><code>editize.php</code></td>
      <td>The <em>Editize</em> API for PHP. This PHP library will generate the 
        HTML and JavaScript code neccessary to display the <em>Editize</em> applet 
        on almost any browser or operating system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><code>kunststoff.jar</code></td>
      <td>The Kunststoff Look &amp; Feel. Improves the look of the <em>Editize 
        </em>user interface dramatically, but adds 43KB of Java files for users' 
        browsers to download the first time they visit your site. If you delete 
        this file, Editize will simply run without any visual enhancements, and 
        will load slightly quicker over slow modem connections.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><code>osx.html</code></td>
      <td>A small Web page containing JavaScript that allows <em>Editize</em> 
        to behave like a form field on Mac OS X browsers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><code>index.php</code></td>
      <td>A sample PHP script that demonstrates how to create <em>Editize</em> 
        form fields compatible with most browsers.<sup>*</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><code>index-mac.php</code></td>
      <td>A sample PHP script that demonstrates how to create <em>Editize</em> 
        form fields compatible with most browsers, including Internet Explorer 
        and Mozilla on Mac OS 10.1.<sup>*</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>imglist.php</code></td>
      <td>A sample PHP script that will list the images in a given directory of 
        your Web server for <em>Editize</em> to use as an image list.<sup>*</sup></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p class="note">* Files marked with an asterix are sample scripts only, and 
    are not required for <em>Editize </em>to function on your server.</p>
  <p>See the next section to discover the meaning of the file called <code>PLACE 
    YOUR LICENSE FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY.TXT</code>.</p>
  <h2>Step 2: Put your <em>Editize</em> license file on your server</h2>
  <p>If you are installing <em>Editize </em>on your own machine for local testing 
    (i.e. the site you are working on will be accessible as <code>http://localhost/...</code> 
    or <code>http://127.0.0.1/...</code>), you do not need a license file and 
    can skip this step.</p>
  <p>In most cases, however, you'll want to deploy <em>Editize</em> on a server 
    that is accessible to other people. To do this, you will require an <em>Editize</em> 
    license file. You can get a free trial license file from the <em><a href="http://www.editize.com/">Editize</a></em><a href="http://www.editize.com/"> 
    Web site</a> (click 'Download' and choose the type of license you need).</p>
  <p>There are two types of <em>Editize</em> licenses. A <strong>hostname license</strong> 
    lets you use <em>Editize</em> on a Web site with a particular hostname (e.g. 
    mysite.com). If your Web site is accessible with more than one hostname, (e.g. 
    admin.mysite.com and mysite.com), you will need a license file for each hostname. 
    In most cases, <em>Editize</em> <a href="http://editize.com/support.php">Customer 
    Support</a> will be happy to issue you with additional hostname licenses for 
    use on a single Web site at no extra charge.</p>
  <p>A <strong>private network IP license</strong> lets you use <em>Editize</em> 
    on a Web server within a private network. This is useful for Intranets and 
    home networks where servers may not neccessarily have hostnames or even fixed 
    IP addresses. In most cases, <em>Editize</em> customer support will be happy 
    to issue you with a temporary private network IP license for a test server 
    while you are developing a site that will eventually be launched on the Internet 
    with a hostname license.</p>
  <p>If you have a hostname license, the file will be called <code>editize.<em>hostname</em>.lic</code>. 
    If you have a private network IP license, the file will instead be called 
    <code>editize.lic</code>. In either case, copy or upload the file into the 
    same folder that you created in Step 1 above. There is a file called <code>PLACE 
    YOUR LICENSE FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY.TXT</code> to remind you to do this, which 
    you can delete if you like.</p>
  <h2>Step 3: Try out a sample script</h2>
  <p>The <em>Editize</em> folder on your server contains a couple of sample scripts 
    for you to try out. Each of these scripts contains a form with an <em>Editize</em> 
    field in it. When you submit the form, the script should display the HTML 
    document you created in <em>Editize</em>, and allow you to load it back into 
    the original form to edit further.</p>
  <p>Open your Web browser and type the URL to load the <code>index.php</code> 
    script in the <em>Editize</em> folder on your Web server into the address 
    field. <em>Note: If your computer is a Macintosh running Mac OS 10.1, load 
    <code>index-mac.php</code> instead.</em></p>
  <blockquote>
   <p><strong>Example 1: Running the sample on your Web Host</strong><br>
    If your Web site is hosted by a Web hosting company, the <em>Editize</em> 
    files should now be in a folder in the root of your Web site (e.g. <code>http://www.yoursite.com/editize/</code>). 
    To load the <code>index.php</code> sample script, type <code>http://www.yoursite.com/editize/index.php</code> 
    into your browser's address field.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example 2: Running the sample on your local test server</strong><br>
      If you've placed the <em>Editize</em> files in a folder on your local test 
      server, you should be able to run the index.php test script by simply typing 
      <code>http://localhost/editize/index.php</code> into your browser's address 
      field.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Have a play with the sample form, submit a document, and then re-open it 
    for editing. If you run into any problems, see the <a href="../troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> 
    section of this manual. Otherwise, you're good to go!</p>
  <h2>Step 4: Integrate <em>Editize</em> into your own scripts</h2>
  <p>You can add the following code to the top of any PHP script to load the <em>Editize 
    </em>API for PHP:</p>
  <pre class="tag">&lt;?php <span class="attributename">require</span>('<em>path/to/</em>editize.php'); ?&gt;</pre>
  <p>For instance, if you placed the <em>Editize</em> files including <code>editize.php</code> 
    in a the <code>C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\editize</code> folder on your server, you 
    can simply type:</p>
  <p> <code class="tag">&lt;?php <span class="attributename">require</span>('c:/Inetpub/wwwroot/editize/editize.php'); 
    ?&gt;</code></p>
<p>You can now add <em>Editize</em> fields to any form in this page.</p>
  <h3> Basic Syntax</h3>
  <p>As mentioned above, <em>Editize</em> is designed as a drop-in replacement 
    for the HTML &lt;textarea&gt; tag. We will therefore explain how to use it 
    by comparing it with that tag.</p>
  <p>Here is a typical HTML form containing a &lt;textarea&gt; tag:</p>
  <pre>&lt;form action=&quot;...&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
<span class="tag">  &lt;</span><span class="tagname">textarea</span><span class="tag"> </span><span class="attributename">name</span><span class="tag">=&quot;example&quot;&gt;</span>
  This is the document that the textarea will contain initially.
<span class="tag">  &lt;/</span><span class="tagname">textarea</span><span class="tag">&gt;
</span>  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
  <p>The PHP API for <em>Editize</em> is designed so that you can simply replace 
    the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> tag with some brief code to put an <em>Editize</em> 
    field in its place.</p>
  <p>To quickly obtain the code to add an <em>Editize</em> to a form in your Web 
    site, use the <a href="codegen.html">Code Generator</a> to generate it automatically. 
    Alternatively, read on to learn how to write the code yourself.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of the simplest means to invoke <em>Editize</em> as a 
    form field:</p>
  <pre>&lt;form action=&quot;...&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  <span class="tag">&lt;?php
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag"> = new </span><span class="attributename">Editize</span><span class="tag">;
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag">-&gt;</span><span class="attributename">name</span><span class="tag"> = 'example';
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag">-&gt;</span><span class="attributename">display</span><span class="tag">('&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;This is the document that Editize will edit.&lt;/p&gt;');
  ?&gt;
</span>  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
<p>The meaning of the 3 lines of PHP code should be fairly apparent to experienced 
  PHP developers. The first line creates an <code>Editize </code>object, which 
  will do all the work of generating the HTML and JavaScript code to display the 
  <em>Editize </em>applet as a form field.</p>
<p>The second line sets the <code>name</code> property of the object, which is 
  equivalent to the <code>name </code>attribute of a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> 
  tag. You should always specify a field name in this way when you use <em>Editize</em>, 
  although if you don't a default of <code>editize</code> will be used.</p>
  <p>Finally, the third line displays the <em>Editize</em> field; that is, it outputs 
    all of the HTML and JavaScript code to place the <em>Editize</em> field in 
    the page at that point. In this example, we have passed the initial document 
    to be displayed (the equivalent of the contents of the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> 
    tag) to the <code>display </code>method, though <em>Editize</em> will default 
    to a blank document if you don't pass a document to it.</p>
  <h3> Configuration Attributes</h3>
  <p>The <em>Editize</em> applet is very configurable. You can customize the formatting 
    applied by the various styles and tools available, and even specify that certain 
    features should be disabled entirely if they are not appropriate for your 
    environment.</p>
  <p>By default, the <em>Editize</em> API for PHP enables all of <em>Editize</em>'s 
    formatting tools with default format settings. This section demonstrates how 
    to use the properties supported by the <em>Editize</em> API for PHP to modify 
    these defaults.</p>
<p>To set the values of properties, simply specify them as you did for the <code>name 
  </code>attribute in the simple example above. For instance, to create an <em>Editize</em> 
  field with a base font of 12-pixel Verdana, you would use the following code:</p>
  <pre>&lt;form action=&quot;...&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  <span class="tag">&lt;?php
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag"> = new </span><span class="attributename">Editize</span><span class="tag">;
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag">-&gt;</span><span class="attributename">name</span><span class="tag"> = 'example';
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag">-&gt;</span><span class="attributename">basefontface</span><span class="tag"> = 'Verdana'; // SETS THE FONT FACE
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag">-&gt;</span><span class="attributename">basefontsize</span><span class="tag"> = 12; // SETS THE FONT SIZE
    </span><span class="tagname">$ed</span><span class="tag">-&gt;</span><span class="attributename">display</span><span class="tag">('&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;This is the document that Editize will edit.&lt;/p&gt;');
  ?&gt;
</span>  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
  <p>Note that you have to set all the properties you want before you call the 
    <code>display</code> method.</p>
  <p>A list of all supported properties with examples for each is provided in 
    the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> section of this manual, or you 
    can use the <a href="codegen.html">Code Generator</a> to select all the properties 
    you want from a list and have the code generated for you automatically.</p>
  <h2>Step 5: (Optional) Providing a List of Images</h2>
  <p>By default, the Insert Image tool in <em>Editize </em>will prompt the user 
    for the URL of the image he or she wishes to insert. Since it can be a fairly 
    tedious to hand-type the URL for every image, <em>Editize </em>also provides 
    a method to specify a list of images that users may quickly choose from.</p>
  <p>The <code>imglisturl</code> property lets you set a URL from which <em>Editize 
    </em>will download a list of images to present it to the user in the Insert 
    Image dialog. The given URL may refer to a server-side script (e.g. to provide 
    an up-to-date list of images stored in a content management system). If a 
    static list of images is all that you need, you can simply point <em>Editize</em> 
    to a text file of the required format residing on your server.</p>
  <p>The <a href="reference.html#imglisturl">documentation for <code>imglisturl</code></a> 
    in the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> section of this manual explains 
    the required format of the image list. A sample script written in PHP called 
    <code>imglist.php</code> that produces a list of all the images in a given 
    directory and its subdirectories is provided in the <code>php</code> folder 
    of this distribution.</p>
  <h2>Step 6: (Optional) Improving Browser Compatibility</h2>
    <p>By simply replacing <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> tags in your forms with 
      the code neccessary to display <em>Editize</em>, you will be able to provide 
      WYSIWYG HTML editing to users of Internet Explorer 4+, Netscape 6+, or Mozilla 
      for Windows or Linux. To support other browsers, you must make a few more 
      changes to your code.</p>
    
  <h3>Using a Java Submit Button</h3>
    <p>The following browsers do not support the standard for JavaScript-to-Java 
      communication, upon which Editize normally relies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opera 6.01+</li>
      <li>Netscape 4.x</li>
      <li>Internet Explorer for Mac OS 10.2 (OS X &quot;Jaguar&quot;)</li>
      <li>Mozilla for Mac OS 10.2 (OS X &quot;Jaguar&quot;)</li>
    </ul>
    
  <p>To support these browsers, you must also replace the submit button in your 
    form with a Java applet. Instead of an <code>&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;/&gt;</code> 
    tag, you should instead use a line of PHP code similar to the following to 
    add a Java-based Submit button to your form:</p>
    
  <pre class="tag">	<span class="tagname">$ed</span>-&gt;<span class="attributename">displaySubmit</span>('Submit',100,30);</pre>
  <p>The <code>displaySubmit</code> function of the <em>Editize </em>API shown 
    here takes three parameters: the text to appear on the submit button (<code>'Submit'</code> 
    in this case), the width of the button (100 pixels in this case), and the 
    height of the button (30 pixels in this case). Adjust these parameters to 
    your preferred values if you wish.</p>
  <p>The <code>index.php</code> sample script included in the <code>php</code> 
    folder of this archive uses this method to provide greater browser compatibility.</p>
  <p>Refer to the <a href="reference.html#displaysubmit">documentation for <code>displaySubmit</code></a> 
    in the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> section of this manual for further 
    details.</p>
  <h3><a name="integratedsubmit"></a>Using an Integrated Submit Button</h3>
  <p>The Java support in Mac OS 10.1 (OS X) is affected by a bug that causes the 
    Web browser to hang if more than one signed applet appears on a page. On such 
    a page, Java will attempt to display multiple Security Alert dialog boxes 
    at once to allow the user to accept the security certificate for each of the 
    applets. These multiple dialogs cause the browser to hang with the 'spinning 
    rainbow disc' mouse cursor.</p>
    
  <p>To avoid this bug, you must only use one <em>Editize </em>field on any given 
    page. In addition, since the Java-based Submit button discussed in the previous 
    section uses its own signed Java applet, you must remove this button and instead 
    set the <a href="reference.html#showsubmitbutton"><code>showsubmitbutton</code>
    property</a> of the <em>Editize </em>field, which will cause it to display 
    a Submit button at the bottom of the <em>Editize </em>field.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the <a href="reference.html#submitbuttonlabel"><code>submitbuttonlabel</code> 
    property</a> lets you specify the text label that appears on the integrated 
    submit button.</p>
    <p>A sample PHP script that uses this method to provide a Mac OS 10.1-compatible 
    <em>Editize </em>field is available as <code>index-mac.php</code> in the <code>php</code> 
    directory of this distribution.</p>
