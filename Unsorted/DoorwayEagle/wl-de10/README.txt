Installation instructions for DoorwayEagle 1.0

All files and subfolders contained within this folder 
will need to be uploaded to your server (except for 
INDEX.txt, THIS FILE). The following list of files/folders 
need to exist in the same directory on your server: 
------------------------------------
files (folder - and all of its contents)
images (folder - and all of its contents)
doorwaycode.inc (file) 
help.html (file) 
index.inc (file) 
index.php (file)
makedoorway.inc (file)
------------------------------------

Simply create a subdirectory within your main (or home) 
directory, make sure you chmod it to 777, name it whatever 
you like, and upload the above listed files and folders 
to it. Make sure all files within the folders - 'files' 
and 'images' - are also uploaded.

After you've uploaded all the files and folders correctly, 
with your browser, access the directory on your website in 
which you uploaded it to. For example, if you named the  
directory "doorwayeagle", you would access it using a 
URL similar to: http://host.yourhost.com/doorwayeagle/index.php

If the front page of your new DoorwayEagle script shows up, 
that means it's installed correctly! Pretty simple, huh?
