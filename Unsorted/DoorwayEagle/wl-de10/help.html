			a doorway page spefically for good placement in the search engine you selected. For best results, no matter the format you 
			choose when you create a doorway, it should be submitted to all search engines, not just the one you are targeting. 
			Although some search engines no longer have a free submission service, many still do.

			The Title of the doorway page is an important part of the doorway page creation process. In search engines, this will show up 
			as the clickable link when your listing comes up for a search term. It is recommended that your keywords 
			(or keyword phrases) exist here, but you also want to write a Title that visitors to the search engine will want to 
			click on after they've read your listing. If you can add as many keywords to your Title as possible, at the same time 
			as making potential visitors WANT to click on your link, you're on your way to maximizing your search engine traffic! Be 
			sure to keep the title of the page short, no more than about 10 words in length.

			should be separated by a comma. It is recommended that you have no more than 3 keywords for each doorway page.

			This is what your doorway page will be named on your server when you have finished creating it. Be sure to end the name

			instead. Do not use slashes, or any special characters besides the dash "-", and underscore "_" as mentioned above. Otherwise 
			ONLY use numbers and letters for naming the page. It's normally a good idea to put one or more keywords in the name 
			of your page as well. Separate your keywords by a dash - For example: vintage-collectibles.html
