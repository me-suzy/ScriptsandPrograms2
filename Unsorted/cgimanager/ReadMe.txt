CGIMachine-Access Counter 
Version 2.20 (06-21-98)

Description:
============
CGIMachine-Counter is a fast 32-Bit-CGI-Application for all 
Windows 95/NT-Servers. It includes 25 graphic number styles
for the counter digits. All graphics are embedded in the EXE, 
so no separate graphics files are needed, resulting in a serving
of server space. The counter can be used on all Web Pages on the
server without multiple copies of the application, by setting a 
key for each Web Page that will have a counter. With the included 
Configuration-Software "Watchdog" you can create, manipulate or 
delete counters. Also you have an overview over all counters and 
their hits.

3 new functions in version 2.2 :
================================
1.) you can turn off the count function of any counter, so you can 
    for example display all the counters you use on a special webpage
    for your controll
2.) you can turn off the counter digit and display any graphic you want instead of
3.) you can use your own counter digit you create with any graphic-application
