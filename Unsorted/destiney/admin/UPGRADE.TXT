Destiney.com Scripts v0.3 Upgrade:

1. Upload and uncompress files on server.

2. Perform Upgrade queries in admin/sql/upgrade_*.sql

	mysql destiney < admin/sql/upgrade_0.2_0.3.sql

		or

	mysql> source admin/sql/upgrade_0.2_0.3.sql

	* Upgrade scripts are not all-inclusive.  For example if you are
	upgrading from 0.1 to 0.3, you must perform all the queries in
	both upgrade_0.1_0.2.sql and upgrade_0.2_0.3.sql.


5. Delete the `admin/sql` directory if desired.

6. Rename faq.php-new as faq.php.

	This is so future releases will not overwrite your changes.

7. Rename include/image_rules.php-new as include/image_rules.php.

	This is so future releases will not overwrite your changes.
