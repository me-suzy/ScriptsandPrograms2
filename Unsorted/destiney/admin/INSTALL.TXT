Destiney.com Scripts v0.3 Install:

1. Upload and uncompress files on server.

2. Edit admin/config.php, enter valid system paths, database info, etc.
	
	* Windows user will need to use backslashes(\) not forward
	slashes(/) and as such all backslashes will need to be escaped
	with backslashes.  For example your $base_path will look
	something like this:  $base_path = "C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot";

3. Create a new DB named `destiney`.

	mysql> create database `destiney`;

4. Install MySQL tables from admin/sql/install.sql.
	
	mysql destiney < admin/sql/install.sql

		or

	mysql> source admin/sql/install.sql

5. Delete the `admin/sql` directory if desired.

6. Chmod 777 include/cache.
