</b></font> <br>
<font size="2"><b>How can I refer other members?</b></font><br>
<font size="2">You may place a link with your referral url to ZZ on your website. 
You may add your referral url to your email signature. You can give out flyers

<br>
<font size="2"><b>What is my referral link?</b></font><br>
<font size="2">Your personal referral link can be found on your personal &quot;Referral 
links&quot; page.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2"><b>What can I earn through referrals?</b></font><br>
<font size="2">Members will earn 20% of their direct referral earnings, 10% of 
their indirect referral level earnings, 5% of their 3rd level referral earnings, 
3% of their 4th level referral earnings, 2% of their 5th level referral earnings 
and 1% of their 6th level referral earnings..</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2"><b>Are my referral earnings working?</b></font><br>
<font size="2">Yes, it takes many paid emails received by members to have referral 
earnings show up, even for members that have 100's or 1000's in their downline. 
Referral earnings are displayed once a referred member has earned their referring 
member at least 1 full cent. Technically a member with 1000 referrals that have 
each earned him/her 1/2 cent has earned $5.00 but their earnings will not be shown 
until an individual member has earned them 1 full cent.</font><br>
