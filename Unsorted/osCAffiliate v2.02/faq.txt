Q: Does the tier system in the affiliate system work?

A: No currently this is a placeholder for further development. (next release should fix this)



Q: Does the Affiliate Pay Per Click rate work?
A: No currently this is a placeholder for further development. (next release should fix this)



Q: Why aren't the BannerImpressions not counted?
A: Look in catalog/includes/affiliate_configure.php at the Setting of:  AFFILIATE_KIND_OF_BANNERS



Q: Banner: Links to banners work. Images don't display
A: - In the affiliate_configure.php you can activate a debug modus for affiliate_show_banners.
   - Try changing define ('AFFILIATE_KIND_OF_BANNERS','2');to 1 in catalog/includes/affiliate_configuration.php.
     Then you should see where it tries to get the images from.



Q: Having sold something to a customer via the affiliate link - the sales do show up properly in the affiliates page. 
   But i can not Bill it. I set the threshold down to $3 but I can not get any bill having set. Whenever I press the "Start Billing"-Button it says "Your Affiliates have been sucessfully billed" - but nothing had been billed. 
   Do I do something wrong? 
A: - Have you set the status of the order to delivered?
   - Have a look at: admin/includes/afiliate_configure.php:
	define ('AFFILIATE_BILLING_TIME','30'); // Orders billed must be at leat '30' days old. 
 						// needed if a order is refunded
     Set this to -1 to bill at once



Q: The Build A Link Feature is to complicated
A: You can insert a link for the affiliate in the product_info.php:
   Example:
	       <?php
		if (tep_session_is_registered('affiliate_id')) {
			?>
	       		<a href="<? echo tep_href_link(FILENAME_AFFILIATE_BANNERS,"individual_banner_id=".$product_info_values['products_id']); ?>"><img src="buildalink.gif"></a>
			<?php
		}
	       ?>
   I sugest:

       <td><br><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
	  <td>
	       <?php
		if (tep_session_is_registered('affiliate_id')) {
			?>
	       		<a href="<? echo tep_href_link(FILENAME_AFFILIATE_BANNERS,"individual_banner_id=".$product_info_values['products_id']); ?>"><img src="buildalink.gif"></a>
			<?php
		}
	       ?>
            </td>
	    <td class="main"><a href="<?php echo tep_href_link(FILENAME_PRODUCT_REVIEWS, substr(tep_get_all_get_params(), 0, -1)); ?>"><?php echo tep_image_button('button_reviews.gif', IMAGE_BUTTON_REVIEWS); ?></a></td>
            <td align="right" class="main"><input type="hidden" name="products_id" value="<?php echo $product_info_values['products_id']; ?>"><?php echo tep_image_submit('button_in_cart.gif', IMAGE_BUTTON_IN_CART); ?></td>
          </tr>
        </table></td>



Q:Affiliate Payment - Having trouble understanding the "START BILLING" function
A:	What does this function do:
	It checks which affiliate has earned enough to get money since last billing.
	Only orders with status 3 (delivered) or higher are considered.(Admin->Configuration->affiliate->Order Min Status) 
	and the Orders must be Billing Time days old (and not have been billed before).(Admin->Configuration->affiliate->Billing Time) 
	Then you can get a list with affiliates who get money from you (-> invoices are possible; if you pay them you can change the status to paid)



Q: Whats individual affiliate percentage?
A:	If you activate this you cab give each affiliate his own provission (via affiliate details).
	If it's higher then the global provision, it's used. If it is set lower than the global provision then its ignored.



Q: Warning: Missing argument 7 for tep_mail() in /home/virtual/site6/fst/var/www/html/test/mgr/includes/functions/general.php on line 1087
A:	Adjust your tep_mail functioncall in admin/includes/functions/general.php:
	function tep_mail($to_name, $to_email_address, $email_subject, $email_text, $from_email_name, $from_email_address, $email_background='') {
