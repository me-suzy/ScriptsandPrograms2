NOTE: This is a loaded release version of the osCAffiliate module for osCommerce.

This release is based on the development version of osCAffiliate which can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/oscaffiliate

PLEASE NOTE. THIS IS A LOADED VERSION BASED ON THE CVS DEVELOPMENT VERSION.

The module has been designed to be intergrated into osCommerce. 
While the module is based on the release version of osCommerce 2.2 Milestone 2.

It may be possible to intergrate this module with CVS versions of osCommerce 2.2 but no support is given, 
due to the constantly changing code base of the CVS

Unlike some other mods this module has been designed in such a way as to have 
minimal impact on the osC core files, which allows for easy upgrades as newer 
versions of the module are released.


For details on the official development version of this module go to:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/oscaffiliate
