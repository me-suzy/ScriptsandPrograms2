<DT><h3>1. Description</h3>

<DD>1.1 MailChek is a web-based email service which provides access to your POP email 
account from anywhere in the world using any computer which can connect to the 
internet. It can check for mail; read, reply to, forward and delete messages and
attachments; and compose and send new email messages with attachments.<p>

<DD>1.2. MailChek does not initially download messages from your mail server but only
reads headers (to, from, subject etc.) and displays them in the inbox. Therefore
it also acts as an anti-spam, anti-virus agent by permitting you to delete messages
from the mail server before they are downloaded and opened.<p>

<DD>1.3. Email is sent using the script server's internal "sendmail" program therefore
a SMTP mail server is not required. All you need is the login information for 
accessing the POP account i.e logon ID (or username), password and name of the POP 
server.<p>

<DD>1.4. MailChek keeps track of each unique user by setting a cookie containing POP 
account login data on the user's computer. This method is efficient, accurate and safer
than other methods commonly employed.<p>

<DT><h3>2. Other features</h3>
<UL>
   <LI> full MIME support for sending and receiving attachments.<p>

   <LI> can be configured for one person's use or for multi-user support.<p>

   <LI> attractive web pages with side menu can be mostly configured by user. Font and
     colors can be specified for the script to use and a web page template is provided
     through which user can control overall page style and content (banners, text etc. 
     permitted). Any number of different styles can be created and rotated by one
     configuration setting.<p>

   <LI> An HTML help page is included which may be used as is or modified by the user.<p>

   <LI> Since most POP account login information is non-trivial, MailChek provides a
     'remember' option during login by saving it in a persistent cookie on your computer.
     A 'forget' option is also available to erase the cookie on logout. Otherwise it is 
     always erased when you logout. For one-person use, the login data can be specified 
     in the configuration file.<p>

<DT><h3>3. System requirements</h3>

<DD>3.1. MailChek uses cookies to isolate and keep track of individual users and login data.
It also requires the Perl modules Net::POP3 and MIME::Base64 in order to operate. These
modules should already be installed on unix/linux systems. They are available free from
 <a href="http://www.cpan.org" target="new">CPAN</a>. MailChek has been tested with Linux, Apache server and Perl
5.005+. Detailed installation instructions appear below.<p>

<DT><h3>4. Configuration</h3>

<DD>4.1. The zipped archive 'mailchek200.zip' contains the following files. Place them on 
your server as shown:
</DL>

<font face="courier new" size=3><B><PRE>
FILE			CONTENT				LOCATION
mailchek.cgi		main script		cgi-bin or equivalent
attach.cgi		attachment script		"
mailchek.cfg		configuration file		"
mailchek.lib		supplementary routines		"
cookies.lib			"
template.html		page styling			"
help.html		sample help file	cgi-bin or web pages
login.html		sample login page		"
readme.html		this file
</PRE></b></font>

<DL>
<DD>4.2 Open mailchek.cfg in a text editor and set the global values as appropriate for
your website. Examples are included. If you are uncertain of pathnames to use on your
server try the ones that appear in the location bar of your ftp client.<p>

<DD>4.3 If you use login.html make sure you set the &lt;FORM ACTION=...&gt; to access 
the script in accordance with where you have located login.html. If you install it with the scripts 
it would be simply &lt;FORM ACTION="login.html" METHOD=POST&gt;. if you install it with 
your web pages:<br>
 &lt;FORM ACTION="your-domain/path-to-mailchek/mailchek.cgi" METHOD=POST&gt;.<p>

<DD>4.4 If you wish to change the style and/or content of the web pages that MailChek
generates this can be done using two methods:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Fonts, colors and table backgrounds can be specified in mailchek.cfg. This is an
easy method of coordinating MailChek's text and colors with your own page content.<p>

<LI>Open template.html in a text editor like Wordpad (not a HTML editor) and follow the
instructions provided in the HTML comment tags (&lt;!-- --&gt;). Be careful not to change
the content or position of any MailChek tags e.g. &lt;!-- MAILCHEK etc. --&gt;. Do not
add a &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; pair because MailChek does this. Otherwise you are free
to add any content as instructed e.g. page body attributes, background, banners, text 
articles, multimedia etc.<p>

<LI>You can design any number of templates from the original, assign each a unique name
and specify the one you wish to use by assigning the name to '$template' in mailchek.cfg.<p>

<DT><h3>5. Installation</h3>
<DD>5.1 Upload all the files in ASCII mode and set permissions (chmod) as follows:
</DL>
<font face="courier new" size=3><B><PRE>
mailchek.cgi	0755
attach.cgi	0755
</PRE></b></font>

The other files will normally be set to read-only by the server which is fine.<p>
<DL>
<DD>5.2 In your cgi directory (with the scripts) create a sub-directory with the name
you chose for '$tempdir' in the configuration file. Permissions of 0755 should be
sufficient on servers which run scripts under your userid. With others you may have
to chmod 0777.<p>

<DT><h3>6. Support and maintenance</h3>

<DD>6.1 Support is free and may be obtained at: http://www.chezsurette.com/support . There you will find FAQs, a private forum for 
MailChek customers, a download page for script updates and a contact form where customers
can reach us for urgent matters. Please do not use email, it is the slowest method for 
getting help.<p>

<DD>6.2 Upgrades are free for all releases of this version (2.xx).
