<center><table width=80% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 border=1 $subtablebg>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Inbox </b></td><td>Displays the <b>Intercom</b> and <b>Email</b> messages that  you have received. To read a message click on the <b>Subject</b>. To delete one or more messages first mark them by clicking the check boxes to their left, then click the <b>Delete Marked</b> button below the table. Use the <b>Delete all messages</b> button to erase all of them.<p> After reading a message you may <b>Delete</b> it, send it to your <b>Trash</b> folder or <b>Reply</b> to it using the window below the message. It is recommended that, for easier reading,  you start your reply at the top of the window above previous messages. If you prefer, you can erase any or all of the previous messages by selecting text with your mouse then pressing a 
<b>Del</b>(ete) key on your keyboard.<p>
If you wish to print a message on a clean white page, showing nothing but the message, press <font color=red>View printer-ready message</font> below the message. A new browser window will open for this and you can use its normal print (and other) functions. Don't forget to <b>Close</b> (NOT Exit)  the new window when finished.<p>
If you wish to see the entire message header press <font color=red>Show full header</font>. When displayed it will change to <font color=red>Show normal header</font>.</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Trash </b></td><td>This holds the messages that you have <b>Trash</b>ed from your Inbox. You can <b>Read</b> them, then <b>Delete</b> them or <b>Delete all messages</b> at once.</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Sent </b></td><td>This is a separate "trash" folder for temporarily storing messages you have sent to others. You can <b>Read</b> a message, <b>Delete</b> it or <b>Delete all messages</b></td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Address </b></td><td>This is where you store email addresses and other personal information for people that you correspond with more than once. Use the <b>Add</b> button to make a new entry, <b>Edit</b> to make changes to an entry
and <b>Del</b> to delete (erase) an entry. Only <b>Email Address</b> is required, everything else is optional. If you enter a <b>Name</b> it will appear to the left of the Email Address when you send email. To <b>Edit</b> or <b>Del</b> an entry you
must first use your mouse to "turn the radio button on" in the Edit or Del column next to the desired entry.</td></tr> 
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Email </b></td><td>This is how you send regular email to the rest of the world. You shouldn't use this to correspond with members - use <b>Intercom</b> for this because it immediately puts your message directly into their <b>Inbox</b>. 
Email generally gets routed around the internet, makes several stop-overs and gets read by anyone. To send someone email you must know their email address e.g. jsmith@company.com. To aid you in this you are provided with an <b>Address</b> book where
you can store names, addresses etc. which you use regularly. Whenever you make an entry in the Address Book you will find it available in the menu selections to the right of your <b>To:</b> and <b>Cc:</b> fill-in boxes. Also, many users do not know that 
you can enter more than one email address in any of these address boxes if you separate them with commas.<p>
When you receive email you will see an <b>Add</b> button to the right of either <b>From:</b> or <b>Reply-to:</b>. Use this to add the email address to your Address Book. It will open a new browser window displaying the Update form. Close the 
browser window when finished (do NOT use file -> exit).</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2> </td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Intercom</b></td><td> Allows you to send a message to one or more members without using regular email. The message remains within the GroupMail server and is dropped immediately into the member's <b>Inbox</b>. It is very fast!
 There is a scroll box of member names in alphabetical order. Simply highlight (mouse-click) the one you want. You can select more than one recipient in two 
different ways: hold the "Ctrl" key down while you highlight the ones you want; or, if you want 2 or more consecutive names, "click and drag" the mouse over them i.e. left-click the first one, hold the button down and drag the mouse over the group  you wish to highlight.</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Members </b></td><td>Displays a list of all active group members (and the Postmaster). You can choose to send an <b>Intercom</b> message to one or more members or read the member's 
<b>Profile</b> (personal file) if it exists. </td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Profile </b></td><td>Lets you record your own profile for other members to read or lets you change what you already have written. Children under 18 should NOT include real name or address. 
You can do this after you start corresponding by <b>Intercom</b>. After you have become comfortable with the facility you may wish to place at least your real name in your profile</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Password </b></td><td>If you find it too hard to remember the funny password our registration robot gave you then you can change it to something
else. It should be something you won't forget easily but too hard for someone else to guess. It can be made up of letters, numbers and "_" only and should be at
least 8 characters long. Don't forget to save it in a safe place! You can also add, update or delete another email address by which you can be contacted</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Logout</b></td><td>This ends your email session and sets a logout cookie in your browser. This is to prevent someone else who uses your computer from accessing your GroupMail account.</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Attachments</b></td><td>This facility supports receiving and sending attachments when using both Email and Intercom. At the bottom of the message compose form click the <b>Browse</b> button which will pop up a file 
search window. Select the files to attach. They will be uploaded to your temporary attachments folder, attached to your message and sent.<p>
For <b>Email</b> the files will then be deleted from your attachments folder. For <b>Intercom</b> the files will remain in your attachments folder for a few days so that the recipient of your message can retrieve them. The length of time they remain there is set by the
administrator. You will note however at the bottom of the Intercom compose form that you can empty your attachments folder any time you wish.</td></tr>
<tr colspan=2>
<td valign=top>$mainfont<b>Important Notes </b></td><td>1. Please do not let old messages pile up in your mail folders. Use the <b>Delete</b> button to erase them. The cleanup robot is not exceptionally smart so when it removes expired messages it might trash something you wish to keep. If you need to save an old message print it out on paper using your browser's <b>Print</b> button or
cut and paste it onto your computer's hard drive. If in the future more server storage space is acquired the members' message quota can be increased.<p>
2. If you lose (or forget) your password simply Login with only your Username and you will meet the Punishment Robot who will make you answer the question you gave it when you registered. If you forgot that, then you must send a regular email to 
(or phone) the Postmaster who will punish you even worse!<p>
3. GroupMail maintains correct identification and separation of  members who are logged in by use of a "cookie" which it sets in your browser. If you are
controlling cookies make sure you permit this to be set.<p>
4. We are always working to improve this email facility so from time to time we will be upgrading the system with corrections or new features. Please help in this endeavour by informing the Postmaster (via Intercom) of any errors, ommissions or perhaps a feature which we might be able to add.</td></tr>
