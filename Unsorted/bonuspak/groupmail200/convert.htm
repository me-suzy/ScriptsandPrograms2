<DT><b>Password encryption</b>
<DD>This procedure is to be used only when upgrading GroupMail from a previous version which used
passwords stored in clear, unencrypted form. It uses Unix one-way encryption to convert original, non-encrypted 
passwords into secure, unreadable form. If applied to passwords which are already encrypted the passwords will 
be rendered useless. Under normal operating conditions this should not be possible because after encryption the
server-owned file 'encrypt.log' is created. The script will not proceed with encryption if this is present. Also, a javascript
 warning is issued when the button is pressed. However, in the event of mishap due to e.g. alteration of script, worm, 
virus etc. the previous passwords may be restored ensemble from a backup copy of the registration files. If this is not 
possible then there are three other options:<p>
1. Members can login with username only and receive a new password by correctly answering the question they 
provided during registration.<p>
2. Members can be 'killed' and re-registered however they will lose all existing data such as mail, address books, 
uploaded files and profiles.<p>
3. Using a web-based utility script, which acts in the capacity of server, you may perform repairs on individual registration
files and also retrieve a member's forgotten answer so he/she may obtain a new password. Scripts such as this should be
installed only for an emergency and then removed from the server.<p>
If you understand and agree to this action proceed by pressing the <b>Encrypt passwords</b> button<p>
