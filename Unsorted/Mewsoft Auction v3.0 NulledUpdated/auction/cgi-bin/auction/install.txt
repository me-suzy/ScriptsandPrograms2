Details of the installation instructions
============================

1. Unzip the file "auction.zip".
---------------------------------
Place the file "auction.zip" in any directory on your computer and then unzip it. The unzipped directory structure is
the same structure of the program as it should installed on your server.  The file unzip under two main directroies 
as follows:
unzip directory/cgi-bin/auction
                        /html/auction
The directory /cgi-bin/auction and all its subdirectories and files should be transferred to your server cgi
directory. The directory /html/auction and all its subdirectories and files should be transferred to your server non
 cgi directory (also called documents directory or html directory or root directory). 


2. Edit the first line of all *.cgi files to point to location of Perl on your server.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open all *.cgi files only with any text editor and change the first line only in each file to point to perl 
location on your server. Normally it should be one of the following:

#!/usr/bin/perl
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
#!C:\perl\bin\perl.exe -w 

If you do not know where perl is located, ask you system adminstarator, or if you have a Telnet you may run 
these commands to find where is perl located as well as sendmail program only if your are on a unix server:

which perl5
whereis perl5

also for the mail program location:

which sendmail
whereis sendmail

Remember to insert "#!"  in front of the perl location directory as follows:
#!/usr/user/perl

You can also download the free script file "testserver.cgi" from our site and install it on your server, it will 
display all your server information.

3. Rename *.cgi to *.pl if your server requires the .pl extension for Perl scripts(or to any other extension).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The executable files comes with *.cgi extension only. This is the extension required on most servers for 
executable files. If your server requires Perl programs to use the ".pl" extension or any other extension, 
you should rename *.cgi files to *.pl. 


4. Edit the file "path.setup" with any text editor and the file "autoclose.cgi"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the file "path.setup" with any text editor or notepad and edit these four variables in the file:
Set the variable "$Program_CGI_Directory" to your server CGI Directory Path
$Program_CGI_Directory="/www/mewsoft/cgi-bin/auction";

Set the variable "CGI Directory URL" to your system URL to the cgi-bin directory
$Program_CGI_Directory_URL="http://www.mewsoft.com/cgi-bin/auction";

Set the variable "$Program_HTML_Directory" to your server htdoc (html) directory
$Program_HTML_Directory="/www/mewsoft/auction";

Set the variable "$Program_HTML_Directory_URL" to your server htdoc (html) directory URL
$Program_HTML_Directory_URL="http://www.mewsoft.com/auction";

Now Open the file "autoclose.cgi" with your text editor, look for the line that looks like
this at the top part of the file:

#Set this variable to point to the directory"auction" on your cgi-bin directory 
$Program_CGI_Directory="/home/www/mewsoft/cgi-bin/auction";

Edit this variable $Program_CGI_D.irectory also to point to your auction directory
on your server cgi-bin directory

5. Transfere all files and directories with the same directory structure on your computer.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These instructions assume that you have FTP access to the server and that you have some basic knowledge of
how to use an FTP program to go to different directories on your site, create directories when necessary,
and to upload files to your server.  If you do not have this basic knowledge, we recommend getting an FTP
program such as WS_FTP (http://www.ipswitch.com/), CuteFTP (http://www.cuteftp.com/), BulletProof FTP 
(http://www.bpftp.com/), or FTP Voyager (http://ftpvoyager.com/ , the best) and reading its documentation 
thoroughly in order to learn how to use such programs.

When uploading all of the text files for the software, be sure to set your FTP program to 
transfer in ASCII mode (the graphics files, such as those ending in ".gif" and ".jpg", should be transferred in Binary mode).
The scripts, Templates, Language files and setup files will NOT work properly if you transfer it in binary mode.

If your FTP program allows you to transfer the directory and all its subdirectories (such as FTP Voyager, 
BulletProof FTP) then you can in one step transfer all the /cgi-bin/auction directory and all its subdirectories
and files to your cgi directory and also in one step transfer /html/auction and all its subdirectories
and files to your html directory, in this case you can scip to the next step.

Use any FTP program to connect to your server.  Then, change directory to your "cgi-bin" 
directory and create the following subdirectories

auction
auction/data
auction/data/archive
auction/data/custom
auction/data/database
auction/data/database/archive
auction/data/database/items
auction/data/database/maillists
auction/data/export
auction/data/items
auction/data/language
auction/data/language/English
auction/data/lock
auction/data/maillists
auction/data/secure
auction/data/temp
auction/data/templates

Important note, when creating the language directory "auction/data/language/English", use the first letter
captalized for the language name "English". You will be able to create other languages from the admin menus.

Now change directory to your document directory(your HTML directory or non CGI directory), and then create 
the following subdirectories:

auction
auction/backup
auction/images
auction/upload

Now transfere the files from your computer to the corresponding directories on your server.
Transfere all *.cgi, *.pm, *.setup, and *.txt files in ASCII mode.
Transfere all other files in Binary mode.
here is the directory structure tree as it should be:

cgi-bin directory:

/cgi-bin/
       |-auction
                |
                |-custom
                |-data
                      |-archive
		      |-custom
                      |-database
                                 |-archive
                                 |-items
                                 |-maillists
		      |-export	
                      |-items
                      |-language
                                    |-English
                      |-lock
		      |-maillists
                      |-secure
                      |-temp
                      |-templates


html direcory:

/html/
           |-auction
                    |-backup
	            |-images
                    |-upload



6. Change permissions on all files and directories.
---------------------------------------------------

Setting permissions is the very important for the program to run correctly. Changing files permissions is 
different from operating system to onther. Here is the a comparison between Unix and Windows permissions 
values and meaning:

Unix Permissions values:
===================================================
Owner                Group                Other
----------------------------------------------------
Read (4)             Read (4)            Read (4)
Write (2)            Write (2)            Write (2)
Execute (1)        Execute (1)        Execute (1)	
=====================================================

If you are on a Unix server, use your FTP program to change files and directories permissions.
You may also set permissions from your Telnet program, log into your server using "chmod" command.
Here are the required permissions on each directory and file:

The cgi directory:

auction (unix : 0755, windows executable)
auction/data (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/archive (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/custom (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/database (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/database/archive (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/database/items (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/database/maillists (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/export (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/items (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/language (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/language/English (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/lock (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/maillists (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/secure (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/temp (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/data/templates (unix : 0777, windows writable)

The HTML directory:

auction (unix : 0755, windows executable)
auction/backup (unix : 0777, windows writable)
auction/images (unix : 0755, windows executable)
auction/upload (unix : 0777, windows writable)

Now change permissions for files in the cgi-directory/auction to (755) using FTP or Telnet,
/cgi-bin/auction> chmod 755 *.cgi, *.pm

Change permissions for files in all subdirectories under the data directory to writables files (777):
auction/data/custom/  chmod 777 *.pm
auction/data/  chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/archive/  chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/database/ chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/items/ chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/language/ chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/language/English/ chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/maillists/chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/temp/chmod 777 *.*
auction/data/templates/chmod 777 *.*

Most subdirectories are empty at the installation time, these directories will be used later by the program.


7. Run the Admin program from your web browser and setup the program configuration.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now before you go further, you need to know if the following perl modules installed on your server or not.
If not installed, you need to install first:
I)- perl module "DB_File"
2)- perl module "cwd"
3)-perl module "File:Copy"

To help you determine if these modules installed or not, run the program "testserver.cgi" from your web browser,
this file is available with the auction package in the same cgi files directory.

Now you have done a great gob. If you have carefully followed all of the instructions above, you are now ready
to start the admin program to complete the program confoguration and installation. Please point your browser 
to the URL of the "admin.cgi" file as follows:

http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/auction/admin.cgi

where "www.yourdomain.com" would be replaced by your actual domain name. Please note that if you renamed
the "admin.cgi" file to "admin.pl" or to any other name, you would need to adjust this URL accordingly. 
Only each time you run the admin program you need to login as the system admin, the default login "User ID"
is "admin", and the default password is "admin". Change these login information once you login for your system security.

If the "admin" program runs now, the great gob, the remaining part is very easy. You should see now the admin
program main menu.

From the admin menu run the "Configuration" utility by clicking on "Configuration". Change all path's and URL's
to point to your server and all other information. These information are very important to run the "auction.cgi"
program and all the auction software.

The next step is from the admin menu also to set the default language for the auction program to start properly.
To do so, click on "Language Manager" from the admin main menu, then set the default language to "English"
by selecting the "English" language and click on "Submit", then click on "Initialize languages".

The last step in the configuration is loading the default database, defalut categories and configuration.
To do so, from the admin main menu, click on "Database", from the database menu click on 
"Load  System Database From The ASCII Backup", this will do all the job for you.

Now if everything done as it should be you have finished the installation.


8. Run the auction program from your broswer.
---------------------------------------------

If you finished all the previous installation steps correctly, you will be able to run the auction program from 
your browser. To to so, please point your browser to the "auction.cgi" program on your server as follows:

http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/auction/auction.cgi

where "www.yourdomain.com" would be replaced by your actual domain name. Please note that if you renamed
the "auction.cgi" file to "auction.pl" or to any other name, you would need to adjust this URL accordingly.

If the program run and you see the main categories page, the congratulations, and thanks for this great gob.


9. Register as a user and test the program settings.
---------------------------------------------------
Now the program is runing, but to make sure that all the installation process completed correctly, you need to test
all the program functions. To to so, Please register as a user and test every single function as it requires the use
to do. For example, submit it, edit your registration information, create auction Alerts, check the emails sent out.
This will help you detect any problems with the program installation, for example, files not transfered in the correct
mode, permisssions not set, directories not created. To automate the process of resubmitting and closing the items see
the online manual for installing the program "autoclose.cgi" as a cronjob using your unix crontab program or similar
utilities on Windows systems.


10. If you have any problems contact Mewsoft Support.
