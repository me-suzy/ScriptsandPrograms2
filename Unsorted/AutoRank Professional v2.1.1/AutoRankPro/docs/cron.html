<li><b>What Is Cron?</b>

<p>

Cron jobs are a way of automating tasks that you 
want done every week/month/day and at a certain time.

<p>

NOTE: cron needs full paths for everything, so you 
must use full paths in the variables in a cgi script

<p>

<li><b>A Quick Overview Of Crontab Entries</b>

<p>

An example of a crontab entry could be:<br>
25 0 1 * * /usr/web1/home/html/cgi-bin/update.cgi

<p>

which runs a script in /usr/web1/home/html/cgi-bin called update.cgi
at 12:25 am on the first of every month. 

<p>

<li><b>In Depth Explanation of A Crontab Entry</b>

<p>

An entry consists of two parts - a time to run, and a command to run. 

<p>

The time to run (the first part of the entry) is broken up into 5 fields:<br> 
1. minute of the hour <br>
2. hour of the day (on the 24 hour clock) <br>
3. day of the month <br>
4. month of the year (1 = January, 2 = February, etc.) <br>
5. day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ..., 6 = Saturday) <br>

<p>

A &quot;*&quot; in one of these fields indicates that the job should be executed 
at any or every one of these, so for instance a &quot;*&quot; in the month of the 
year field means that this task should be carried out every month at the 
time specified in the other fields. A &quot;*&quot; in the day of the week field, 
when there is something in the day of the month field, does not mean that 
this task should be carried out every day, but rather that it should be 
carried out on the appointed day of the month regardless of what weekday 
it is. Only &quot;*&quot;s in the day of the week field, and the day of the month 
field, and the month of the year field would indicate a daily task. 

<p>

Examples:

<p>

The job with this time to run would run every Sunday at 12:20 am. <br>
20 0 * * 0<br>
This job would run at midnight on any Friday the 13th. <br>
0 0 13 * 5

<p>

You don't have to put just one time in a field. This job, for instance, would 
run every day at 12:30am, 2:30am, 4:30am, 6:30am, 6:30pm, 8:30pm, and 10:30pm: <br>
30 0,2,4,6,18,20,22 * * *
<p>
This one would run every Tuesday and Friday at 5:30 am: <br>
30 5 * * 2,5
<p>
<li><b>Using Cron Jobs With AutoRank Pro</b>
<p>
The first thing you will need to do is setup all of the scripts to work with cron.
By default, the scripts do not use full directory paths, however they are required
for use with cron.  So, you will need to edit a few of the CGI scripts.  
<p>
In functions.cgi edit the following variables:<br>
<b>The full path to sdata:</b><br>
$fnct::sd_dir = "./sdata";<br>
<b>The full path to members:</b><br>
$fnct::md_dir = "./members";<br>
<b>The full path to templates:</b><br>
$fnct::tp_dir = "./templates";
<p>
In cron_rr.cgi edit the following variable:<br>
<b>The full path to the directory that holds functions.cgi:</b><br>
$rr::cgi_dir = "/path/to/autorank/cgi";
<p>
In cron_rs.cgi edit the following variable:<br>
<b>The full path to the directory that holds functions.cgi:</b><br>
$rs::cgi_dir = "/path/to/autorank/cgi";
<p>
Create a new plain text file named cronfile (or you can edit the sample included with the software).
Any other cron jobs you are running should also be placed in this file.
In this file you will put the following lines:
<p>
0 0 * * * /full_path_to/cgi-bin/cron_rs.cgi<br>
30 * * * * /full_path_to/cgi-bin/cron_rr.cgi
<p>
This will run cron_rs.cgi every night at 12:00:00 AM
and cron_rr.cgi every hour on the half hour.
<p>
cron_rs.cgi resets all counters to zero, and cron_rr.cgi re-ranks the list. 
<p> 
If you want these scripts to be run at times other than those, just edit
the times according to how you want it set up.  However, you should have it 
set so that the re-rank and reset script do NOT run at the same time or else
you will have a blank list until the next re-rank.
<p>
If you haven't already, upload the cron_rr.cgi and cron_rs.cgi scripts to the
directory where all the other AutoRank Pro scripts reside.  Set their permissions
to 755.  You can test them by running them from the command line.  Just type in:
/full_path_to/cgi-bin/cron_rr.cgi<br>
If any output is produced, there is a problem - most likely something with permissions.
Make sure all of your list pages are set to 666 for permissions.
<p>
Now upload cronfile to your server in ASCII mode.
Telnet into your account and go to the dir you uploaded cronfile into.
<p>
Type: crontab cronfile
<p>
This should set your cron job.
<p>
If you want to check to make sure it was entered correctly you can type:
crontab -l 
<p>
If you want to remove all cron jobs you can type:
crontab -r
<p>
<li><b>Why should I use cron?</b>
<p>
Cron will give you extremely accurate update times, whereas with
regular cgi you will probably not have this.  With regular cgi updates
the only time the list can be updated or reset is when someone activates
the scripts by clicking on a link to your top list.  So say you have your
list set to re-rank every 30 minutes, but no one clicks on a link to your
list for 45 minutes.  Then the list will not be updated for a period of 45
minutes.  An even bigger problem is with reseting the list.  If someone
doesn't click on your link at the time you want the list to reset it will
throw it totally off.  For example, say the first time the list is set to
reset is at midnight, but no one clicks until 12:30.  That will change
the next reset to 12:30 the next night instead of 12:00.

<p>
Put simply, cron will make your list much more accurate, and can reduce the load
on your server.  If you have it available on your system, please use it.  It is
very simple to set up, and if you need any help you can always get it from us!
