<h3>AutoRank Pro v2.0.x to v2.1.0 Upgrade Instructions</h3>
<font size="2">
Follow these instructions to upgrade your version 2.0.x installation to version 2.1.0<br>
These instructions will also work to upgrade the freeware AutoRank v2.0.0<br>

<b><li></b> Extract all files from the AutoRank Pro v2.1.0 archive you downloaded.<p>

<b><li></b> In each .cgi file, you will need to set the location of Perl 5 on your
server.<br>  This is done on the first line of the file, usually looking something
like:<p>
<font face="Courier">#!/usr/bin/perl</font>
<p>
Where /usr/bin/perl is the location of Perl 5.<p>

<b><li></b> The script now uses default settings for the members, template, and script data
directories.  If you have a directory structure that looks like the following, you can skip this
step: <b>(If you are using cron, do not skip this step!)</b><p>

/home/username/cgi-bin/AutoRankPro/sdata<br>
/home/username/cgi-bin/AutoRankPro/members<br>
/home/username/cgi-bin/AutoRankPro/templates<br>

<p>

If your directories are not named sdata, members, and templates, you will need to edit variables
in the scripts.  functions.cgi, rankem.cgi, out.cgi, search.cgi, and index.cgi will all need to
be setup.  If you are using cron, you MUST use full directory paths.  If you are not using cron
you can use a setup similar to what is already there.  The variables are marked with comments that
will assist you in properly setting them.<p>

<b><li></b> Now, upload <b>ONLY</b> the update.cgi file, in ASCII mode, to the directory
where your current AutoRank Pro .cgi files are located.  Set the permissions on this file to
755; then bring it up in your browser by calling it from the URL at which it is located.
This will update all of your current member database for use with v2.1.0<p>

<b><li></b> <b>Optional Step</b> This next step is optional, but will save you some space on your
server.  You can delete all of the files in the sdata directory, except the following files:<p>

- admin.epf<br>
- members      (GDBM Version)<br>
- members.dir  (SDBM Version)<br>
- members.pag  (SDBM Version)<br>

<p>

None of the 2.0.x data formats are supported by 2.1.0, so you will not be damaging anything by
deleting these files.<p>

Also at this stage you can delete all of the files in your member data directory.  You may want to back
them up to your local computer just to be safe, but again these files are not used by v2.1.0.  They will
only be taking up space on your server.<p>

<b><li></b> Next you can begin uploading the new files.  Start with the files in the sdata directory, then
the templates directory, and finally all of the .cgi scripts.  Upload <b>ALL</b> files in ASCII mode.<p>

<b><li></b> Now you are ready to run setup.cgi.  Bring it up in your browser by pointing it to the
URL at which it is located.  This is where you will set all your variables; descriptions of each are included
in the setup.cgi form.  Your administrative password from v2.0.x will work for v2.1.0<p>

<b><li></b> After you have setup all the variables, you will need to enter the administrative script to
setup all of the HTML for your site, and anything else that needs to be taken care of.<p>

<b><li></b> <b>Note about old accounts:</b> Any accounts created with v2.0.4 or earlier will not be able
to view their passwords.  Those passwords were stored using a one-way encryption algorithm, and no plain
text copy of the passwords were kept.  If you edit any of those accounts from admin.cgi, you will have to
give them a new password - make sure you inform the account holder of the change.
<p>
If the account holder chooses to edit their account, they will have to enter a new password for their account
and it will be stored for later retreival.
<p>
If someone has an old 2.0.x password, and has not updated it, they will not be able to get it from
the password reminder utility.  They must login to their account and setup a new password before they
will be able to be reminded.
<p>
<b><li></b> <b>Note about accounts.cgi:</b> With v2.1.x you can access the account maintenance features by 
having a link to accounts.cgi?login  - Other formats will not work.
<p>

<b><li></b> That's all!  You should now be able to continue normal script operations.
