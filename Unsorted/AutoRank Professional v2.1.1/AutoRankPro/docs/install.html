<b><a name="install">Installation Procedure</a></b>

<font size="1">

<p>

<b>If you are upgrading from AutoRank Pro v2.0.x or AutoRank v2.0.0 please
use the instructions in upgrade.html.</b>

<p>

<ol>

<b><li></b> Unpack the AutoRank Pro archive that you downloaded, using directory names.<p>

<b><li></b> Locate Perl 5 on your server.  In most cases it can be found at /usr/bin/perl or
/usr/local/bin/perl.  Once you have found it, and are sure it is Perl 5, write the location
down.

<b><li></b> If your Perl 5 location is /usr/bin/perl, you can skip to the next step.  If not,
open all of the files that have a .cgi extension in a text editor.  You will need to set
the location of Perl 5 on your server.  This is done on the first line of the file:
<p>
<font face="Courier" size="2">#!/usr/bin/perl</font>
<p>
Change the /usr/bin/perl value to match your system's setup.  If you have telnet access you can locate
perl by typing the following command:
<p>
<font face="Courier" size="2">which perl</font>
<p>
In most cases, /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl is a valid setting.  Note that <b>this must point to
Perl 5</b>.  Ask your server administrator if you are unsure about the perl location.<p>

<b><li></b> Login to your FTP server, and change into the directory where you will be installing the
CGI scripts.  (We recommend that this directory be inside a cgi-bin or equivalent directory) In that
directory, create 3 more directories.  Name them members, sdata, and templates.
These directories will contain all of the files that control script operation.  The HTML files that
the script creates (the files that contain the list) will need to be in a seperate directory located
outside of the cgi-bin.<p>

<b>Example Directory Structure</b>

<table width="100%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">/home/username/cgi-bin/AutoRank</font></td>                 
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">location of .cgi files</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">/home/username/cgi-bin/AutoRank/sdata</font></td>          
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">location of script data files</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">/home/username/cgi-bin/AutoRank/members</font></td>        
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">location where member stats files will be stored</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">/home/username/cgi-bin/AutoRank/templates</font></td>        
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">location of all template files</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">/home/username/public_html  </font></td>                   
<td bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="Verdana" size="1">where the main HTML files will be generated</font></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

<b><li></b> Now, upload all of the .cgi files to the directory that you want them installed in.  Make
sure that you are uploading in ASCII mode.  Next, upload the errors.dat, help.dat, def.html, quick.html,
and search.html files to the sdata directory that you created - again in ASCII mode.  Finally, upload all
of the .htmlt and .etmpl files to the templates directory that you created - in ASCII mode.<p>

<b><li></b> You will now need to set permissions on the files you uploaded, and directories that
you created.  Below you will see a table with recommended permissions settings.  These settings 
should work for most servers, however others may require different settings.<p>

<p>

<b><li></b> You are now ready to begin the WWW based portion of the setup.  In your browser, type in 
the full URL to the setup.cgi file on your server.  This will bring up the portion of the script where
you will set all of the variables.  Details and examples for each variable are given, so follow along
through that to get all of the variables set properly.<p>
After you have set all of the variables, enter the default password <b>admin</b> and click the button.
If everything went well, you will be presented with a page telling you that the variables have been
recorded, and some self tests will be done by the script.  If all the tests pass, you are ready to go
on.  If any of them fail, you will need to check file permissions and directory settings.
<p>

<b><li></b> You should now be ready to begin using the scripts.  The first thing you will want to do is
point your browser to admin.cgi.  Login using the default password <b>admin</b> - make sure you press
the login button with your mouse pointer and don't simply hit enter on your keyboard.  Once inside the
admin script you can start exploring the features, but make sure that you change your administrative
password soon after your initial installation.<p>

In the administrative script, you will find links to "help" near the bottom of each page.  Clicking on
that help link will bring up a description of the function you are working with
</ol>

<p>

<font size="2"><b>Other Installation Notes</b></font>

<p>

<ul>
<li> If you chose to use cron then you will need to do some additional work to install the software.
Please see the <a href="cron.html">cron.html</a> file included with the documentation.
<p>

<li>You will need to <b>provide a link</b> to the page where <b>webmasters can add their site</b>
when you edit the header and footer files for your list.  Somewhere in the header/footer
<b>place a link that points to accounts.cgi</b> so people can add their site.  Members can edit their
information, get detailed stats, and see your banner farm by <b>placing a link that points to
accounts.cgi?login</b>.<p>

<li>If you have any problems, contact us using the <a href="#tech">information</a> at the
bottom of this file.
</ul>

<p>

<hr width="550" size="1" align="center" noshade>

<p>

<font size="2"><a name="postinstall"><b>After Installation</b></a></font>

<p>

Once you have completed the installation you will want to get the list setup and ready
to accept new members.  Here we will outline the steps you will want to take immediately
following the installation.

<p>

<ol>
<b><li></b> The first thing you will want to do is setup the HTML for each of your list
pages.  This is done through the administrative script by using the "Edit HTML For" function.
This is located in the second pull down menu on the main page of the administrative
script.

<p>

<b>Editing the header/footer</b>

<p>

Editing the header and footer for each of your list pages will setup the HTML that appears
above and below the rankings.  All HTML entered in the header will appear above the list; all
HTML entered in the footer will appear below the list.  Any HTML you want can be entered here,
with the exception of a textarea tag.  Typically your header will contain the opening html, title, and
body tags, as well as links to accounts.cgi and accounts.cgi?login so that webmasters can add and
edit their accounts.

<p>

The header and footer do contain some template values.  These will display the last updated time, # of members
in your database, and the site of the moment.  More information about setting these up is found in the
<a href="templates.html">templates.html</a> file.   See the portion labled "Edit HTML For [page]" template in admin.cgi

<p>

<b>Editing the HTML template</b>

<p>

A complete description on how to generate your template can be found in the <a href="template.html">template.html</a>
file included with the distribution.  There is also some additional information in <a href="templates.html">templates.html</a>
which reinforces what was explained in the template.html file.  We will breifly discuss it here as well. 

<p>

The template allows you to insert your own style of how to list the sites.  In the template form, 
you will enter the HTML that will be used for a <b>SINGLE</b> rank.  The script will then use that HTML
for each of the sites in your database. For most applications, each of the template variables should only
appear <b>ONCE</b> in the template. If you find yourself inserting #%BANNER%#, #%DESC%#, or any of the script
values <b>more than once</b> in the template, you are most likely <b>doing something wrong</b>.

<p>

<b><li></b> After HTML is setup for all of your list pages, you can re-rank the list for the
first time.  Do this from the administrative script.  It is the first function available from
the first pull down menu.  Note that you should always let the script create the html files. 
If they already exist on the server, you should delete them before re-ranking the list.  Once
you have successfully re-ranked the list, you can view the output on the HTML files you selected
to have the list written to.

<p>

<b><li></b> The next thing you will probably want to do is edit the templates for the accounts.cgi
script.  These are all located in the templates directory, and can be edited with any HTML editor. 
Each of the files contains normal HTML, and special items that the script recognizes.  The special
values that the script understands are surrounded by #%%#.  You should never edit those values; you
can move them around all you want, but don't change anything between the #%%#.  Complete descriptions
of each of the templates is included on <a href="templates.html">templates.html</a> which is included
with the software distribution.

<p>

<b><li></b> The final thing you may want to do, if you are using double CGI cheat protection, is to
generate a custom version of the rankem.cgi script.  This will allow you to have a customized version
of the gateway page that matches your site.  A complete description of this can be found at the 
<a href="http://www.cgi-works.net/members/autorankpro">owners lounge</a>, where you will generate the
 customized version of the script.

<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Where To Go To Get Tech Support</b><p>
If you need any assistance you can contact us via e-mail by using the
tech support page in the owners lounge at:
<a href="http://www.cgi-works.net/members/">
http://www.cgi-works.net/members/</a><p>
Or you can post a message on our members only message/help board at:<br>
<a href="http://www.cgi-works.net/members/forums/board.cgi">
http://www.cgi-works.net/members/board/forums.cgi</a>

<p>

<li><b><font color="Red">IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT TECH SUPPORT:</font></b><p>

<b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> If you edit the scripts in any way other than described
above, you will no longer be eligible for technical support.<br>
<b>WE WILL NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR EDITED SCRIPTS!</b>

<p>

The only two ways we provide support for our commercial scripts are listed above.
We do it this way to make sure we are providing support only to those who have paid
for the scripts and deserve the support.  If you post a message at the General CGI Board
it will not be answered by us, you must post on the Owners Lounge board.  Also sending
a plain e-mail to us will be ignored, you must use the tech support form in the Owners Lounge.

<p>

These two methods also help to ensure that we are not wasting our time providing
support for illegal copies of our software, and will result in faster responses
to legitimate owners questions.

<p>

Thank You, and enjoy your new script!
