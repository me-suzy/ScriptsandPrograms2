<b><a name="using">Using The Templates</a></b>

<p>

The template feature of AutoRank Pro makes the script extremely easy to integrate into your site.
These files are very easy to edit, but you need to follow a few guidelines.  You should be able to
edit all of the .htmlt files in any html editor and be ok.  All of the .etmpl files need to be edited
in an ASCII text editor such as Notepad in Windows or Pico in Unix.

<p>

<b>The template in admin.cgi</b>

<p>

In admin.cgi when you choose to edit the HTML for one of your main pages, you will be presented with 
a page that has text boxes for the header, template, and footer.  In this file we will discuss the
template, header, and footer portions of that page.
This template works the same way as all the others; the only difference is that you will be entering
the HTML you create into a web-based form instead of editing a template file.  If you do not enter a
template the default template will be used.

<p>

When you edit the template, you will only enter the HTML for a single rank.  The script will then use that
HTML for each of the rankings on the page.  If you find yourself inserting #%RANK%#, #%DESC%#, or any of
those values in #%%# more than once in the template, then you are most likely doing something wrong.

<p>

A different template can be used for each of your pages, so don't feel like you have to stick with the
same look throughout your top list.  If you have any questions, see the <a href="#support">tech support</a> info
at the bottom of this file.

<p>

<b>The .htmlt Files</b>

<p>
These files are used to generate the HTML that the scripts output.
Of the .htmlt files, there are only certain ones you should edit.  Never, ever, edit any .htmlt file that
begins with _admin.  Those are used for the administrative script, and only you the administrator will
see them.  Any editing to those files will result in loss of tech support from CGI Works.

<p>

In each of the files you will find standard HTML and pieces of text surrounded by #%%#.  Anything 
surrounded by #%%# should not be edited.  These are items that will be inserted by the script. You can
move it around all you want, but do not change the value inside the #%%#. 

<p>

Basically you can use any HTML you want.  You should first use the script with the default templates
so you can get a feel of what each #%%# item is replaced with.  Once you have a feel for how they are
working, you can go in and put your HTML in.  If you have any questions, see the <a href="#support">tech support</a> info
at the bottom of this file.

<p>

<b>The .etmpl Files</b>

<p>

These files are used as templates for the e-mails that are sent when a member signs up, or when
a member needs reminded of their password.  They follow a certain format which needs to be maintained
in order for the e-mails to be sent.  That order is:<p>

To: user@domain.com<br>
From: your-email@domain.com<br>
Subject: The subject<br><br>
The body of the message

<p>

Note that there <b>must</b> be a blank line between the Subject line and the body of the message.  Failure
to leave that blank line will result in e-mails not being sent.

<p>

The same format is used in the .etmpl files as is used in the .htmlt files.  All items that the script
will insert are surrounded by #%%#.  Again, do not edit these.  You can move them around all you want
within the e-mail.  Make sure you edit these files in an ASCII text editor such as Notepad.  If you have 
any questions, see the <a href="#support">tech support</a> info at the bottom of this file.

<p>

<b>After editing the templates</b>

<p>

After you have edited the templates to your liking, simply upload them in ASCII mode to the templates
directory you created.  If your FTP client asks you if you want to replace the current version, select yes.
You can verify that the new versions have been uploaded properly by pointing your browser to accounts.cgi
to see if your HTML appears.
