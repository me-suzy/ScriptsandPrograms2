Epal Pro allows you to send actual money orders to anyone using your PayPal 
account. <br>
<br>
Currently, PayPal only allows funds to be emailed from one person to another. By 
using EPal Pro and your PayPal account, we have enabled you to send real payments 
to anyone-- even if they lack internet access!<br>
<br>
This allows PayPal users to continue using their trusted PayPal accounts to 
purchase items from any seller-- including those who do not accept PayPal-- or 
to send payments to people who do not even have an email address.<br>
<br>
EPal Pro users can send money orders to pay their rent (most landlords don't accept 
credit card payments for rent-- now they can!), pay their bills, send gifts, pay 
for auctions to sellers who don't accept electronic payments, and more, all from 
the trust and convenience of PayPal and their home computers.<br>
<br>
EPal Pro is ideal for:<br>
<br>
. Online sellers who do not wish to pay a fee to receive payments<br>
. Sending money to someone who has no access to a computer<br>
. Paying for anything with a money order purchased with PayPal<br>
. Recipients who want payments as accessible as cash but as dependable as PayPal<br>
