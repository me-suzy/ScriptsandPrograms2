<p>In order to operate the EPal Pro service and to reduce the risk of fraud, 
EPal Pro Corp. (EPal Pro or we) must ask you to provide us information about 
yourself. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we 
use that information. EPal Pro takes the privacy of your personal information 
very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms 
of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable 
information or a list of our customers to third parties. This Privacy Policy 
applies to all services that are hosted on the EPal Pro website, whether the 
services are offered by EPal Pro or by its subsidiaries.<br>
<br>
INFORMATION WE COLLECT <br>
1. Transaction Information<br>
When you use EPal Pro to send money to someone else or request money from 
someone else, we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, 
including the amount of the transaction, the type of transaction (purchase of 
goods, purchase of services, or simple money transfer) and the mailing address 
of the recipient. We retain this information for all transactions through EPal 
Pro. Each transaction is assigned a unique order number which is searchable from 
the home page of EPal Pro.<br>
<br>
2. Customer Service Correspondence<br>
If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we retain such 
information in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service 
correspondence and other correspondence from EPal Pro to you. We retain these 
records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate 
potential fraud and violations of our Service Agreement. We may, over time, 
delete these records if permitted by law.<br>
<br>
3. Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data<br>
From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for 
such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' 
interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in 
detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information 
from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given 
notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the 
survey or questionnaire.<br>
<br>
<br>
OUR USE OF INFORMATION <br>
<br>
1. Internal Uses<br>
We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services 
and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to determine 
your eligibility to receive offers for special features or products, and 4) to 
improve our products and services.<br>
<br>
We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to 
those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests.<br>
<br>
2. Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than EPal Pro Customers<br>
EPal Pro will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information 
to third parties. EPal Pro will not share any of your personally identifiable 
information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described 
below, or with your express permission (and to other EPal Pro customers as 
described above). These third parties are limited by law or by contract from 
using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the 
information is shared. <br>
<br>
1. We share information with companies that help us process the transactions you 
request and protect our customers transactions from fraud.<br>
<br>
2. We disclose the information we collect, as described above, to companies that 
perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with 
whom we have joint marketing agreements. These companies are subject to 
confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit 
using the information except to market the specified EPal Pro-related products 
or services, unless you have affirmatively agreed or given your prior permission 
for other uses.<br>
<br>
3. We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to 
cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct 
investigations of violations of our Service Agreement. Specifically, this means 
that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged 
in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information 
(but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.<br>
<br>
4. We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, 
levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal 
process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.<br>
<br>
5. We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the 
holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).<br>
<br>
6. We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public 
relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users 
live in Michigan. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally 
identifiable information.<br>
<br>
7. As with any other business, it is possible that EPal Pro in the future could 
merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the 
successor company would have access to the information maintained by EPal Pro, 
including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this 
Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described above. <br>
<br>
3. Our Contacts with EPal Pro Customers<br>
We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested 
services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or 
investigate suspicious transactions. We use your e-mail address to send you 
confirmation of payments that you send or receive through EPal Pro, to send 
information about important changes to our products and services, and to send 
notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out 
of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature 
rather than promotional.<br>
<br>
In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and 
operations, the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to 
confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors cannot use 
personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
<br>
4. Internet Address Information<br>
We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, 
administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic 
information for aggregate use. <br>
