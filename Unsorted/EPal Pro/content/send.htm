EPal Pro allows you to send Travelers Express International Money Orders to 
anyone with a mailing address.<br>
<br>
Common uses for EPal Pro Money Orders: <br>
 Pay for an auction item<br>
 Send money for online purchase<br>
 Pay your credit card or utility bills or other debts<br>
 Send a gift of money to a friend or relative<br>
 Send a donation to your favorite charity<br>

<br>
Because EPal Pro orders can be paid with your trusted PayPal account, you can 
use your credit card or checking account to fund the money order. The recipient 
does not need to have an email address or access to the internet, so you can 
send payments to more people worldwide using EPal Pro than you can using PayPal 
alone.<br>
