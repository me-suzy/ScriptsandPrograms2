Some Servers do not honor the flush() buffer 
statment in php and some browsers will not load
other frames if some of the frames have not 
finished loading. if you are still reading this 
a minute from now or all you ever see is the 
words <b>Refreshing...</b>.. Then then your server does not
honor the flush statment. do not worry.. There is 
still hope for you :-). To Fix this Click on the 
<b>Admin</b> tab and select <b>refresh</b> as the type of
chat and then click save. This will solve the problem. 
do it now!! because if you are reading this line then it 
is not working and you need to change it to Refresh mode....
