    See the changelog.txt file for the other changes.</div>

  <h2 align="left">New since Version 0.1.5-Alpha-01</h2>
  <p align="left">THE TABLE FORMAT HAS CHANGED AGAIN!<br>
    THE TABLE-FILES HAVE A THIRD LINE FOR THE COLUMN-INFORMATIONS NOW.<br>
    IN THIS LINE ARE THE DEFAULT VALUES FOR EACH COLUMN.<br>
    TO MAKE PORTING FROM PREVIOUS VERSION EASY, JUST ADD A NEW LINE UNDER<br>
    THE DATATYPES LINE, AND WRITE AS MANY # AS THE LINE ABOVE HAS, AND<br>
    NOTHING ELSE. OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO SPECIFY THE DEFAULT VALUES IN THIS<br>
    LINE NOW :)<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><a href="examples/tut2.html">Here</a> you can see how a table 
    in the new format looks like.</p>
  <p align="left">Aliases for Tables (SELECT only).</p>
  <p align="left">Added Infos about Reserved words.</p>
  <p align="left">The CREATE TABLE Statement changed, you can use the Keyword 
    DEFAULT now, to<br>
    specify a Default Value for a column.</p>
  <h2 align="left">New since Version 0.1.4-Beta-01</h2>
  <div align="left">
    <p>The latest alpha seems to work fine, so the api has beta status now.<br>
      Please note that this should be the most stable version of the api at <br>
      the moment. The old versions without &quot;-Beta&quot; like &quot;0.1.1&quot; 
      aren't more<br>
      stable. I just had another versioning convention in early developement.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Windows </b>(\r\n==\xd\xa) and Unix (\n==\xa)<b> newlines are supported 
      now.</b><br>
      Please note that the txt-db-api still only writes Unix newlines, but<br>
      tables which contain Windows newlines are also read correctly now.<br>
      MAC (\r==\xd) Users should convert their text files, to use another <br>
      newline format. </p>
  </div>
  <h2 align="left">New since Version 0.1.3-Alpha-02</h2>
  <p align="left"><b>ATTENTION: THE TABLE FORMAT CHANGED IN VERSION 0.1.3-Alpha-02! 
    <br>
    WHEN A # IS PART OF A VALUE IT ISN'T STORED AS %# ANYMORE, <br>
    IT'S STORED AS %h NOW !! TO CONVERT YOUR OLD TABLE FILES JUST<br>
    OPEN IT IN A TEXT EDITOR AND SEARCH FOR %# AND REPLACE IT WITH %h.<br>
    TAKE CARE NOT TO REPLACE %%# WITH %h, BECAUSE THIS HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING<br>
    IN THE OLD FORMAT (THE % IS ESCAPED WITH % RESULTING IN A <br>
    SINGLE % AND # IS A NORMAL VALUE DELIMITER IN THIS CASE!)<br>
    ALSO % ISN'T STORED AS %% ANYMORE, IT'S STORED AS %p NOW, DO THE SAME AS<br>
    ABOVE TO CONVERT OLD TABLE FILES.<br>
    ALSO, THE # AT THE END OF EACH LINE MUST BE REMOVED!</b></p>
