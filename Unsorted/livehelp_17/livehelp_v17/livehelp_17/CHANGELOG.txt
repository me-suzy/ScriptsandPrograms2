   onkeypress was not being recorded. Fixed this.

   ensure that the connections is being closed some users were getting 
   max connection errors.. 
 - Added an "EXIT chat" link on the user end so that the user can close the 
   chat session. 
 - added a shorter timout for the admin user so that if the admin operator
   closes their admin without logging out their status will turn to offline
   2 minutes later.. 
 - Added error codes to the log in screen so that if the wrong username 
   or password is entered it tells you you entered the wrong username/password
 - added a forgot your password screen for thoes who forget their password.
 - added code that refreshes the admin chat after 30 seconds of inactivity
   to avoid script timeout errors..

   is online.

   the way it is shown in continous mode.
 
version 1.6: (Released: 05-02-03)
----------------
 - Added some extra javascript code to the users list frame to make
   sure that it keeps reloading.. for some reason it stops after
   an hour or so. The javascript is a double check..

   try to avoid max connections errors..     $mydatabase->close_connect();

   database for users who have a hard time running the setup.

   top of the file.

   the window focus is called.

version 1.3: (Released: 04-30-03)
----------------
 - combined chatting users and current visitors frames into one frame.
   Tried to use DHTML to now have to re-load the users frame but as it
   turns out IE does not like to load two frames infinitly at the same
   time.. WTF.. I have the code there but commented out.  
 - added a field to `livehelp_config` ADD `use_flush ` VARCHAR( 10 ) DEFAULT 'YES' NOT NULL ;
 - fixed upgrade in setup.php so that older version users can upgrade to new version.
 - added support for non-flush() servers. Servers that insist on buffering the output
   until the entire page is loaded...
 - When you click on log out it marks your status now as offline.. 
 -

version 1.2: (Released: 04-28-03)
----------------
 - As it turns out The HTTP Authentication hooks in PHP are only available 
   when it is running as an Apache module and is hence not available in 
   the CGI version which was causing internal server error on a few peoples
   installations. I re-programmed user_access.php to use a cookie login. 
 - get_magic_quotes_gpc is now used instead of get_ini to see if the user
   has magic quotes on or off and a new extraction is used in config.php 
   to extract the global vars and add slashes. (I like magic quotes) 
 - Added a LOG OUT button to allow operators to close the admin.
 - took out javascript alert for new user in chat and replaced with 
   java sound wav.
 - added referer to the details of the user.. I will make it look better in 
   a later version...
 - Fixed issue with leave a messsage window always poping up if the user 
   was requested for a chat then went away and then came back again when 
   the operator was not around.. 
 - added additional check in setup to make sure users with txt-db-api can 
   write to their text database.

----------------

 - Added support for new $_POST $_GET and $_COOKIE that 
   replace the $HTTP_*_VARS in newer versions of php.
 - Created a new field in livehelp_operator_channels table
   called "bgcolor" of type varchar (10). This field allows
   me to color code the users to allow it to be easier to 
   separate the chatting users.. 
 - Fixed bug with the leave a message script where the 
   e-mail from address was not being sent.
 - Fixed bug with users entering in the same username or name as
   an already exisiting user.

   prompt showing before the user enters their name if 
   ask for name option is selected.
