  <p>If you wanted to make a dynamic PHP-Website you had two choices:</p>
  <p>1. You could save your Data in Text-Files in a self defined format. This 
    has one big<br>
    disadvantage: You'll have none of the advantages a SQL Database could provide, 
    <br>
    such as performing common SQL commands like SELECT, INSERT, or UPDATE, as 
    well as <br>
    filtering or setting the order of a result.</p>
  <p>2. You could host your website on a webserver that supports a database software, 
    but<br>
    websites hosted on such servers regularly cost extra money.</p>
  <p>That's where the &quot;Txt-Db-API&quot; could help.<br>
    With the &quot;Txt-Db-API&quot; you can access normal Text Files like a SQL 
    Database.<br>
    You don't need any special Database Software on the Webserver, yet you can still use 
    SQL!<br>
    You can use the API to create, query, change, or delete tables, and you 
    don't<br>
    have to bother with the Text-Files themse.  Almost everthing can be done 
    with<br>
    the included API calls.</p>
