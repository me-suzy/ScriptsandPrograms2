<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Upload the files:</h2>
<p>All PHP Files ot the Txt-Db-Api must be uploaded in one directory.</p>
<h2>Change the File txt-db-api.php</h2>
<p>Before uploading all the .php files the file txt-db-api.php must be changed.<br>
  You have to set the two Vars $API_HOME_DIR and $DB_DIR to correct values.</p>
<p><b>$API_HOME_DIR:</b><br>
  This variable must be set to the absolute or relative path where all the Txt-Db-Api 
  Files are located.<br>
  For example: /home/c-worker.ch/public_html/php-api/</p>
<p><b>$DB_DIR:</b><br>
  This variable must be set to the absolute or relative path where the database 
  folders are. <br>
  For example if you have a database folder at /home/c-worker.ch/dbs/TestDB, set<br>
  $DB_DIR to /home/c-worker.ch/dbs/. Now you can have 1 or more folders in the<br>
  /home/c-worker.ch/dbs/ folder, each representing a singe database.</p>
<p>The file txt-db-api.php doesn't change in new versions. Don't overwritte it 
  when you<br>
  install a new version. Just keep the old file! If this file will change, i'll 
  put a big notice<br>
  in the changelog!</p>
<h2><a name="abs"></a>Absolute or relative Paths for API_HOME_DIR and DB_DIR</h2>
<p>You can set the $API_HOME_DIR and $DB_DIR vars to either relative (relative 
  to the file which<br>
  includes txt-db-api.php) or absolute (relative to the server root) paths. </p>
<p>If you use absolute paths, you only need one txt-db-api.php file.<br>
  This file should be placed by the other files of the Text-Db-Api (where it is 
  by default<br>
  when the zip file is extracted).</p>
<p>If you use relative Paths, I REALLY RECOMMEND to let each project have its 
  own<br>
  txt-db-api.php file. This file should be placed in the Folder of the corresponding 
  project.<br>
  This is neccessary because differrent projects may have another relative Path 
  to the<br>
  API and Database Directory. So each project will now include its own txt-db-api.php 
  <br>
  File located in its folder.<br>
  In the API Folder you now, no longer need a txt-db-api.php file, sience each 
  project has its own.</p>
<p>If you want, you can also let each project have its own txt-db-api.php file 
  when using<br>
  absolute paths. This might be usefull if you want to use different Database-Roots 
  for<br>
  each Project.</p>
