Known Errors

Error with permission denied show up on UI alongside congrats notice!
   - Partial fix - sorry message now appears!

Error were if user tries to edit efile.php through efile.php the script redirects to login page.
   - Fixed! If usere enters efile.php nothing happens. To edit efile.php first duplicate it,
     then edit the copy before deleting the original and renaming the copy efile.php

Major flaw - Script requires the users host server to have register_globals to be turned on.
   - Being fixed - if your reading this it should be fixed. Other small compatibility issues are
     also being fixed along side this.
