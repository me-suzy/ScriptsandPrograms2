ABOUT THIS MODULE
-----------------

This module will display different icons for the uploaded files on the
files browser depending on their extensions. It checks the extension of
the uploaded files and see if an icon with a corresponding name exists
in the /icons folder.

Works only with ezUpload 2.2.0


------------
INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module, simply upload all the files in the /ezupload
directory of this zip file to the ezUpload directory on your server.

ADDING NEW ICONS
----------------

You can easily add new icons by simply uploading new images on the
/icons folder and the script will automatically recognize them. The
files must use the gif extension and the size of 16x16 is recommended
although not necessary.
