ABOUT THIS MODULE
-----------------

This module adds a file browser accessible outside of the control
panel, so that users other than the administrator can access it.
To access the file browser, add "?mode=browse" at the end of the
URL of the upload form. This new file browser use the same header,
footer and fonts as the upload form.

If user authentification is turned on (on the "Access Control" page
of the control panel), then only the uploads made by the logged user
will be displayed.

Works only with ezUpload 2.2.0

INSTALLATION
