1) Provide New and Innovative Tips each Week or Month.
I would Suggest to Start off with a Monthly Publication,
because you'll get less unsubscribers and they know
you're honestly trying to build a publication that
establishes community, and not trying to spam them.

2) Provide Some Free Content in Each Issue. This will Keep
the Freebie Seekers on your List.

3) Before Sending out a Newsletter, make sure that the
Newsletter Doesn't Span More than 60 Characters. Many
Email Clients will have to Scroll from side to side
to read your Newsletter if you do. Plus, OptIn Lightning
Automatically Wraps at 60 Characters, so it's dummy Proof.

4) To Test the Newsletter for Formatting and Typos, send
the Newsletter to yourself the day BEFORE you send it
to your list. Then, Print it out and read it that night
and keep a marker with you and make all the corrections
you need to. 

5) The Next Morning, make all the Corrections and send it to
yourself again. Check Briefly for Uneven Formatting and
Line Breaks. Make Sure under Any Circumstances that Any 
Line Exceeds 60 Characters.

6) Follow a Consistent Format. Find a Format you feel your
Readers will be Comfortable Receiving and Stick with it!

7) Never Quit! This is Probably the Most Important Piece of
Advice for the New Publisher. You might Get Discouraged
at First Because No one Seems to be Responding or Purchasing
from you. Remember, Rome Wasn't Built in a day. Eventually,
you WILL Develop a Loyal Group of Niche Prospects that are
Waiting to Hear about your Products and/or Services. 

8) Once you Start a Newsletter, Keep it going. Remember, it
only takes 2 hours per Month to Send out a Monthly 
Newsletter. That's just 24 Hours Per Year. I'm Convinced
ANYONE can find that kind of time, no matter how Busy
They Are! If you Stop a Newsletter and Start it up again,
people will think you're Fickle and not want to do 
business with you. Plus, you'll get a Ton of Unsubscribers.
Yes, even Big Companies are Guilty of this, but that 
doesn't mean you need to be. Just Accept Running a 
Newsletter as an Important Part of Doing eBusiness.

9) Don't Abuse Your List. In Other Words, if you want to
send out a Solo Mailing Occasionally to Announce a Supreme
Event, Fine but make sure you let them know this when you
Subscribe. Plus, I wouldn't do this for at least 6 months
until you've built the Trust of your Subscribers. This is
another area where you *MUST* use Common Sense. No Matter
what the Announcement, ALWAYS include a Freebie for the
Freebie Seekers. At least that's what I do.

10) Run a Contest. At Your Discretion of Course, offer a
FREE CD, T-Shirt of something of Value to every 100'th
or every 250'th Subscriber. This will get people to tell
their Friends about your List, and will get people to keep
checking back at your site. Next thing you know, you're 
getting flooded with Subscribers! You can Announce this
Contest in your Newsletter.

11) Find Ezine Administrators with small Ezines and try
to do Ezine Swaps with them. This will help you grow your
list faster than just publishing it on your own.

12) Don't Get Discouraged. This Advice is Extremely 
Important to the Beginner. If you get an Occasional Flame
or Lose Some People After Each Mailing, this is normal!
Even The Best Lists Lose People After Each Mailing. There
are always Stupid People out there that aren't happy with
anything no matter how good it is. This Does NOT mean that
your Newsletter isn't Quality. Maybe they have too much 
going on to read your Publication. Just roll with the punches,
and you'll get use to running an Ezine After a Few Months.

If You're Looking for Structural Ideas, I've included the

Structure an Internet Newsletter that Builds Community.

These Simple but Effective Guidelines will get you Started in
Putting Together a Newsletter People will Love and Recommend
to Their Friends and Associates.
