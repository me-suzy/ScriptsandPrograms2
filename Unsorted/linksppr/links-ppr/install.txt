2.7 For automatic updating of links directory and bids - need cron usage.
you must have telnet/ssh access to your site for this.
In other case - you must manually perform all updates (run nph-build.cgi).
All directory/bids/etc autoupdate functions is located in nph-build.cgi

From cron usage:
you need to edit cron file (located in same directory where this readme file)
open it in text editor and change path to location of nph-build.cgi in your system.

If you have many advertisers - will be better if you change updating period
to half of hour.

After editing, upload cron file in /admin directory and from shell 
enter to this directory and enter
crontab cron

it all.
