<font color=900000><b>Your CGI Folder</b></font><p>
You need to open the cgi folder on your local system. Inside the folder there is another folder named "personals". Open the folder "personals", and find the file "configdat.lib". Using your text editor, open the file "configdat.lib", and edit it according to the instructions indicated by the comment tags you will find throughout.<p>After you have edited "configdat.lib", transfer the folder "personals" from your local system to your remote cgi directory in ASCII mode.
<p><ul><li>Set permissions on all .pl or .cgi files contained inside the folder and sub-folders to 755 (-rwxr-xr-x)
<li>Set permissions on all .txt contained inside the folder and sub folders to 777 (-rwxrwxrwx)</ul><p><p>

As long as you have configured configdat.lib correctly, your program should work when you login from
index.html as a member. Before you can access index.html you must first upload it and all other files and folders that
belong in the html direcetory. See below:<P> 

<font color=900000><b>Your HTML Folder</b></font><p>
Inside your html folder there is a folder named "personals". You need to transfer this folder with all its contents to your remote HTML directory.<p>

<font color=900000><b>Permissions for HTML directory files and folders</b></font><p>

<b>HTML Paths and URLs
</b><p>
In the HTML "admin" folder there are 3 files
<ul>
<li>admin.html
<li>index.html
<li>login.html
</ul>

The URls in these files need to be changed to fit your site. If the form action does not
post to the location where you have installed the cgi personals directory, change it to 
post to the correct location.<P>

The main file "index.html" where your users sign-up and login should point to your URL. Check the file
and change the URL and/or form action to the correct URL and/or form action relative to your site.<P>


<font color=900000><b>Setting Up The Admin Page</b></font><p>
Run the file setup.pl. This file is located in your cgi "personals" directory and should be called from the browser 
using the relative URL. Running this file will password protect the admin directory. You should access either "admin.html" or "login.html"
(the files in your HTML admin directory) to access your admin page.<P>

If you have problems, questions or comments, or find bugs in the program please contact <a href="customerservice@etown21.com">customerservice@etown21.com</a><P>

Thank you for your purchase.
