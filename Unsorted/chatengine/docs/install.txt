	Installing PHP Chatengine
	=========================
	
	I have not supplied a decent installer (yes, yes, I suck :-)) so you will have
	to do some manual work. If you know your way around the MySQL prompt, this will
	all be very easy. And if you happen to be able to use a copy of PhpMyAdmin, this
	will also be a piece of cake. If not, erm... you have a small problem ;-) But you
	can always write a simple PHP script that will import the database_structure.sql file
	and let MySQL handle it. 
	
	You basically need the following tables:
	
	chat_users		The table that contains all chat users
	chat_session_ids	The table that contains currently active sessions
	chat_text_db		The table that contains the text that is being said
	chat_stats		The table that logs a lot of user information
	chat_images		The table that contains references to usable user icons
	ipbans			The table that contains IP numbers that have been banned
	
	chat_users, chat_session_ids, chat_text_db and chat_images are the tables that
	actually "display something" to the users. The chat_stats table is only used to
	store information, but I have not supplied a decent front-end to present this
	information. It's up to you to make that. Ipbans is something I don't use anymore
	myself because of the proxy problem. If a school uses a proxy, it will show one
	IP-address for a lot of computers. Meaning that if you ban one IP-address, you will
	ban a group of users. And my visitors happened to be on the same schools a lot...
	So you know what happened ;-) 
	
	If you created these tables using the database_structure.sql file, all you will have
	to do to finish the process, is to copy all files to a webserver (and please keep
	the same directory structure - "icons" and "images" on the same place, or change it
	but don't forget to update the references in the scripts too). Then you will need
	to modify the mysql.php3 file to fit your MySQL database account. The includes.php3
	file contains more settings that can be altered. Play around with them to see
	what they do exactly. Don't forget to add a user account for yourself, which has
	sysop rights (group 2). Now surf to the URL where you placed the engine and have
	a lot of fun :-)
