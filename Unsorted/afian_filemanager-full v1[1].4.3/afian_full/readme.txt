- Free space: 300KB

Afian was tested and found to be working in:
- Internet Explorer 5.5, 
- Internet Explorer 6.0, 
- Opera 7.10 
- Mozilla 1.14

In Mozilla and Opera you may encounter graphic glitches in the interface, due to imperfect support of CSS and Javascript by those browsers. Those glitches are merely cosmetic -  Afian should work properly even with those glitches.
