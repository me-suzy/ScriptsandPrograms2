<h2><a name="5.1">5.1<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</a></h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>Installing In-link has never been any easier!  It comes with 
  a web-based fully automated installation program that will do most of the installation 
  and configuration work for you.  Unfortunately, due to platform differences 
  and incompatibilities there is no way to guarantee a flawless installation so 
  we strongly recommend that you monitor the installation very carefully as you 
  might have to complete some of steps manually.  The installation program will 
  guide you through the entire process and will give you concise and detailed 
  instructions throughout the installation.  Installation program contains five 
  easy steps and if at any point it safely determines that some of the steps do 
  not apply to your server, it may even skip them!</p>
<h2><a name="5.2">5.2<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Installation Process</a></h2>
<h3><a name="5.2.1"></a>Overview</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Below is the quick installation procedure to follow.  We described 
  all the steps in detail; however, please only follow the instructions applicable 
  to your server in order to simplify the installation process:</p>
<h3><a name="5.2.2"></a>Download</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Before you can run the install script, you need to know the 
  following: In-link comes in a zip file called  <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Courier New";'>in-link</span> and followed by the version number.  Example: 
  <span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>in-link2_0_3.zip</span> is a compressed file containing 
  In-link version 2.0.3.  In order to retrieve the files from the zip file, you 
  need to uncompress it by using a utility such as WinZip (<a
href="http://www.winzip.com/">www.winzip.com</a>).<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Download In-Link and unpack all the individual files. Make 
  sure that all the files are present. (A list of all files that come with In-Link 
  is in the Appendix.)</p>
<h3><a name="5.2.3"></a>Upload</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>After you uncompress (unzip) the distribution you should see 
  a number of files and directories that make up In-link. Upload all the files 
  to your web server using your FTP software (such as WS_FTP, CuteFTP or FTP Voyager).  
  Please, upload the files to a location on your web server where you would like 
  In-link to be installed.  For example, we recommend creating a separate directory 
  called <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>inlink</span> 
  or <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>directory</span>, 
  but it can be anywhere on your web server, including the home directory (root) 
  where you can place web files. Please, make sure that you upload all the PHP 
  files (such as <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>index.php</span>) in ASCII 
  mode and all the images in templates in the BINARY mode.  Generally, your FTP 
  software such as CuteFTP (<a
href="http://www.cuteftp.com/">www.cuteftp.com</a>) can correctly determine if 
  the files should be uploaded in ASCII or BINARY mode; but please do check to 
  make sure that the transfer mode is set correct. You can check the settings 
  in the configuration screen of your software or some software may prompt you 
  for certain file types.<span style='font-size:14.0pt;'> <br>
  <br>
  </span></p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
background:#FFFFD9'> 
  <p class=warning>! Make sure all the PHP files are transferred in ASCII mode!!<br>
    <br>
  </p>
</div>
<h3><a name="5.2.4"></a>Database Setup</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Set up a database for use with In-link.  For security purposes, 
  we recommend that the user of the database is other than root and that there 
  is a password set for that user.  Then, please write down the database name, 
  database server (normally <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>localhost</span>), 
  database user and the user password.  You will need this information later. 
  Also, make sure to give permission to the database user to DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, 
  and UPDATE. </p>
<h3><a name="5.2.5"></a>Installation Program</h3>
<h4>Running</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>You can now run the installation script.  The installation 
  script is called <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>install.php</span> and it 
  is located in the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Courier New";'>admin/</span> directory of your In-link copy. It should be run 
  in your web browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator).  
  After you made sure that the database is setup and that all of the files are 
  uploaded, proceed to open the installation script <span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>../admin/install.php</span> in your web browser 
  by specifying its location on the web server.  For example, if you installed 
  In-link on <a
href="http://www.yourserver.com/">www.yourserver.com</a> in the directory <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>inlink/</span>, then in 
  your browser address/URL field just type in<br>
  <a href="http://www.yourserver.com/inlink/admin/install.php">http://www.yourserver.com/inlink/admin/install.php</a>.  
  This should load the installation program that will guide you through the installation 
  process.</p>
<h4>Step 1  License</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Please enter your first name, last name and your In-link registration 
  number.  This is the information that was e-mailed to you when you purchased 
  In-link and it is included on your purchase receipt.  If you lost you registration 
  receipt you can have it e-mailed to you at the same e-mail address that you 
  used when you purchased In-link.  <i>Note</i>: you cannot proceed installing 
  without this information.  If you dont have the registration number, please, 
  contact Intechnic Corporation sales or customer service department in order 
  to obtain the registration number.  After you enter the information, press Next 
  Step.</p>
<h4>Step 2  Program Location</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In this step the installation program will attempt to determine 
  the location of In-link on your server. In-link needs to know its exact location 
  in order to function properly.  In most cases, In-link successfully determines 
  the information it needs. However, it is a good idea to always check to make 
  sure that the determined path matches the correct location of the script on 
  your server. <br>
  <br>
  There are two paths that you need to specify:  The Server path is the actual 
  path to the files on your server. This is the path you would see when navigating 
  to the In-link files on your server ( Ex.: <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>/home/user/public_html/inlink/</span> 
  ). On Unix/Linux you can see what this path is by typing in the command <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>&quot;pwd&quot;</span> in 
  your shell session window (Telnet) while located in the same directory where 
  In-link is. The URL path is the path that you would see in your browser address 
  field; it is usually the URL path following your domain. (Ex.: for <a
href="http://www.yourserver.com/inlink">http://www.yourserver.com/inlink</a> the 
  URL path would be <span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>/inlink/</span>). After you entered and verified 
  the information, press Next Step.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
background:#FFFFD9'> 
  <p class=warning>! Please, include the trailing slashes (&quot;/&quot;) after 
    both paths.<span style='color:maroon'><br>
    <br>
    </span></p>
  <p class=warning>! On some Windows NT/2000 servers the path cannot be determined 
    accurately, please pay extra attention to the system paths if you are using 
    a Microsoft server.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
</div>
<h4>Step 3  File Permissions</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In order for In-link to function properly, you need to have 
  certain file permissions to set correctly.  In some cases, In-link will attempt 
  to set file permissions automatically. Unfortunately, most configurations will 
  not allow that, in which case you either set the file permissions manually or 
  use the batch script that is included with the installation. The install script 
  will check the following files/directories:<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=codeChar style='margin-left:1.05in;'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span><span style='font-family:Courier;'>config.php</span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'> 
  file used to store your database settings and other system information.</span><br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.05in;text-indent:-.25in;'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>themes</span>  directory containing themes or template 
  sets that are used by the system to format the output.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.05in;text-indent:-.25in;'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>languages</span>  directory containing the language 
  files.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.05in;text-indent:-.25in;'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>backup</span>  directory for the database backup 
  files.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:0in'>The install program will tell 
  you if all of the permissions are set correctly and you will be able to safely 
  proceed to the next step. If this is the case, you can skip reading the remaining 
  portion of this section.<br>
  <br>
  In most cases In-link installation program will show you the following message:<br>
  <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:red'>In-link could not 
  set file permissions automatically due to the server configuration. Please set 
  the above permissions manually or use the batch script to do that</span>.  
  This means that the script failed to set permissions automatically and you will 
  have to do it manually.  </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:0in'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:0in'>In order to set the file permissions 
  you can use a shell script <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>permissions.sh</span> 
  that was included in the installation package to automate the process for you.  
  In order to run this script you need to telnet to the server, proceed to the 
  admin directory and run the script in your shell session window (<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>../admin/permissions.sh)</span>.  
  If the scrtip runs successfully you can skip the remaining part of this section.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:0in'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin-left:0in'>If the script does not run 
  correctly, you can either telnet to a shell on the server and enter the command 
  &quot;<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>chmod 777 &lt;filename&gt;&quot;</span> 
  or use a ftp client to set the permission to world readable and writeable.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>If you are on a Unix server, set the file permission of the 
  configuration file (<span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>includes/config.php</span>) to <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>777(drwxrwxrwx)</span> 
  so the installation script can modify it.  On a Windows server, please make 
  sure that the file is writeable.  (On some Windows servers you might have to 
  modify <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Courier New";'>config.php</span> manually).</p>
<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Set the permissions on all the template files and directories 
    (<span
     style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>themes/)</span> to 777 
    or wireteable.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Set the permissions on all the language files and directories 
    (<span
     style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>languages</span>/) to 
    777 or wireteable.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Set the permissions on the backup directory (<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>backup/</span>) 
    to 777 or wireteable.</li>
</ul>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in'>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
background:#FFFFD9'> 
  <p class=warning>On some systems the files cannot be written by PHP and you 
    will have to modify config.php manually with the database information.  Open 
    config.php and insert the database information.</p>
</div>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in'><span style='color:#3399FF'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>Step 4  Database Configuration</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In order for In-link to operate at all, it needs access to 
  a database already setup and running on the server.  Unfortunately, installation 
  program cannot setup the database for you and it is often a manual process.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Prior to proceeding to the next step make sure that you have 
  a database set up on your server. The database user must have full access to 
  the database. Also, make sure to give permission to the MySQL user to DELETE, 
  INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE.  After you entered and verified the information, 
  press Next Step.</p>
<h4>Step 5  Security</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In order to access In-link administration utility you need 
  to set up a root administrative user.  This user can never be deleted and overrides 
  all the other users.  The root user overrides all of the Administrators in the 
  system and cannot be deleted. Please, exercise caution when setting the root 
  password. In many cases your data cannot be recovered if the password is lost. 
  After you entered a new root password, press Next Step.</p>
<h3><a name="5.2.6"></a>Administration Utility</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>After completing the installation script you will be asked 
  to proceed to the administration utility in order to customize the rest of In-Link.  
  In order to access the administration utility you will be asked to log in with 
  your root username and password.  Thats it: In-link is ready to run!</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
background:#FFFFD9'> 
  <p class=warning>After the installation it is a good idea to remove install.php 
    from your live server. Theoretically, anybody who has your registration number 
    could modify your system settings.</p>
  <p class=warning>For increased security it might be also a good idea to password-protect 
    the entire admin directory.</p>
