<h1><a name="admin">6<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Administration 
  Panel</a></h1>
<h2><a name="6.1">6.1<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</a></h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>This Administration Panel is the heart of In-link. All of the 
  administrative functions of In-Link are controlled from here.  The purpose of 
  having the Administration Panel is that the entire database maintenance services 
  and all of the system settings can be performed and controlled though a secure 
  centralized online administration utility.  The administration panel is laid 
  out in a most straightforward and intuitive way and provides advanced functionality 
  for easy and effortless updates and maintenance tasks to any part of the In-link 
  system. In the administration panel you can add, delete, or edit categories, 
  links, users and reviews. You can use the Administration panel to validate pending 
  data, filter out duplicate or inaccurate information, etc.  Administration panel 
  allows you to customize and configure your entire In-link site and you can also 
  perform database backups and restorations along with data imports and exports 
  directly from the Administration Panel.</p>
<h2><a name="6.2">6.2</a><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Navigate &amp; 
  Modify</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>Allows the admin to navigate and modify the entire system as 
  a standard user would through the similar front-endhowever, many administrative 
  options are available here. </p>
<h3><a
name="navigate">Navigate</a></h3>
<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In-link Navigate &amp; Modify interface allows you to navigate 
  the directories normally and add, delete, or edit any categories or links within 
  them.</p>
<h4>Sorting and Ordering</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>The Navigate &amp; Modify interface allows you to change the 
  view option for sorting and ordering of links and categories for administrative 
  viewing purposes.  You can choose to view links sorted by Name, Date, Description, 
  User, URL, rating, Votes, Hits, Rating, Votes, Hits, Visibility Factor, Editor's 
  pick and Image.  You can sort categories by Name, Date, Description, User, Number 
  of Subs, Permissions, Number of links, Visibility Factor, Editor's Pick and 
  Image. You can also change the output order (Ascending or Descending) for both 
  links and categories and the number of link results to display per page. The 
  sorting and ordering administrative view option allows more efficient maintenance 
  of multiple categories and links.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>See also: Configuration | Output</p>
<h4>Searching</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>The search box allows you to easily search for categories or 
  links in the system for the ones matching the search query.  </p>
<h4>Advanced Searching</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In order to perform advanced search, click on the Advanced 
  Search link on the bottom of the main search box. Advanced Search allows you 
  to perform field-specific and range searches (A date range, for example) on 
  links and categories, as well as it allows you to specify the Boolean type of 
  search and the number of results returned. Advanced search also allows you to 
  search by the values of custom fields.</p>
<h3><a
name="addlink">Add Link</a></h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Clicking on the Add Link button allows you to add a link 
  to the category where you are currently located. Add link form has several important 
  features that are worth noting:</p>
<h4>Category Selection</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Add Link has a powerful category selection tool that allows 
  you to cross-reference links in more than one category. When you are adding 
  a link the system gives you full list of the categories where you are submitting 
  the link.  The categories list can be modified by removing and adding additional 
  categories. Additional categories available for selection are represented by 
  a dropdown list that features all of the root categories where permissions 
  allow the link to be cross-referenced.  Selecting a category allows you to peek 
  into the sub categories in that category that will also be represented by an 
  updated dropdown list. Pressing Add this category button will add the selected 
  category to the list of the categories where the link is being referenced.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>See also: Configuration | Users &amp; Permissions</p>
<h4>Name, URL, Description</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>The name, URL and Description of the link represent the functional 
  part of any link as such. Link name and URL are the only two required fields.</p>
<h4>Rating, Votes, Hits</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Every link has three fields introduced for statistical purposes. 
  Rating specifies links average rating given to it by users. Votes stands for 
  the number of votes placed by users on that link and hits signifies the number 
  of clicks through the link by the users. As an Administrator, you can set the 
  initial values to any of these fields. POP and TOP markers are dynamically 
  calculated by the system and are based on the rating, hits and votes. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>See also: Configuration | Output</p>
<h4>Date Created</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Please, note that the links date field affects the NEW link 
  marker.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>See also: Configuration | Output</p>
<h4>Editors Pick</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>A link marked as an Editors Pick will be displayed before 
  all other links, no matter what field the sorting is done by.  Editors Picks 
  links also have a separate template and can be modified to look different from 
  the rest of the links.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>See also: Configuration | Output</p>
<h4>Link Owner</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Link owner field specifies the user who is the owner of the 
  particular link.  If end users are allowed to modify their links, this field 
  will specify which user is allowed to modify the link.</p>
<h4>Visible</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>The visibility field allows the Administrator to temporarily 
  disable selected links.  The disabled links will not be shown to the end user; 
  however, the Administrator will be still able to see them.  The disabled links 
  are marked as such. A new link is visible by default.</p>
<h4>Link Graphic</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>This field allows storing a link-specific image that can be 
  displayed together with each link record. This functionality allows displaying 
  link-specific logos, icons, photographs etc.</p>
<h4>Custom Fields</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Any link record offers up to six custom fields that could be 
  customized for any purposes.  The name, as well as the usage for those fields 
  can be controlled through the Configuration.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a
name="addcat">Add Category</a></h3>
<h4>Name, Description</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>The Name and Description of the category represent the functional 
  part of each category. Category name is a required field.</p>
<h4>Date Created</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Please, note that the categorys date field affects the NEW 
  marker.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>See also: Configuration | Output</p>
<h4>Category Owner</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Allows to set an editor for that particular category.  As In-link 
  includes multi-editor capabilities, you can use this field to assign a user 
  as an editor for that particular category (please make sure to update the users 
  permissions under Users and Permissions as well.)</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>You can also grant access to all of the subcategories to the 
  same editor by checking the Change all subcategories to this user? box.  If 
  you prefer, to retain all of the sub category permissions for those users who 
  are editors, you can do so by selecting the Keep existing sub category users, 
  if they are editors option.</p>

  <p class=warning>Please note that all of the category editor permissions in 
    the subcategories will be rewrittne recursively if you use this option and 
    can not be restored!</p>
  <p class=warning>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h4>Editors Pick</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Any category marked as an Editors Pick has a special marker 
  PICK displayed next to it.</p>
<h4>Permissions To Add Links To Category</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>This is a powerful feature of In-link that allows the Administrator 
  to set category-specific permissions in order to restrict submitting of links 
  by end users to designated categories. The permissions are divided into two 
  parts: Registered Users and Not Registered Visitors. For each user type, adding 
  of a link to a category can be either: a) Allowed only upon the approval of 
  the Administrator (the added link becomes pending) b) not allowed at all c) 
  added directly into the database. Please, note that the permissions are category 
  specific and by default they inherit the permissions of the parent category.  
</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>See also: Configuration | Users &amp; Permissions</p>
<h4>Visible</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>The visibility field allows the Administrator to temporarily 
  disable selected categories.  The disabled categories will not be shown to the 
  end user; however, the Administrator will still be able to see them.  All disabled 
  categories are marked as such. A new category is visible by default.</p>
<h4>Category Graphic</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>This field allows storing a category-specific image that can 
  be displayed for each category. This functionality allows displaying category-specific 
  logos, icons, photographs etc.</p>
<h4>Meta Keywords</h4>

  keywords that can be used for indexing purposes by search engines.</p>
<h4>Meta Description</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>This field allows Administrator to set category-specific META 
  description that can be used for indexing purposes by search engines.</p>
<h4>Related categories</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Allows to select categories featured as related categories 
  to this particular category.</p>
<h4>Custom Fields</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Any category record offers up to six custom fields that could 
  be customized for any purposes.  The name, as well as the usage for those fields 
  can be controlled through the Configuration | Data Structure.</p>
<h3><a

  Administrator to modify link-related data.</p>
<h3><a
name="editcat">Edit Category</a></h3>
<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Edit Category screen is similar to the Add Category screen, 
  allowing Administrator to modify link-related data, except for:</p>
<h4>Apply Category Permissions to Subcategories</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In the edit mode you can force to apply the currently selected 
  category-specific permissions to all the subcategories below that category (Recursive 
  Permissions). Checking the box next to Apply Category Permissions to Subcategories 
  will force all of sub categories permissions to be overwritten.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;

<h3><a
name="mvlink">Move Link or Category</a></h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Links and categories may be easily moved to other categories 
  within In-link. Moving a Category with links inside would move all of the sub 
  categories and sub links within that category.  You can move categories and 
  links by licking on Move next to categories and links records.  The updated 
  screen will show a listing of available categories for the move. Simply browse 
  to the appropriate category to select a new category for completing the move 
  action and press Move to this category.</p>
<h3><a
name="dellink">Delete Link or Category</a></h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Links and categories may be deleted from the system. If a category 
  is deleted, all sub categories and links within that category are deleted as 
  well. In-link will prompt you as and additional safety feature when deleting 
  a category.</p>

<h3><a
name="copycat">Copy Category</a></h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Categories may be copied to a different location. Once a category 
  is copied, all sub categories and links within that category are copied as well, 
  preserving the same hierarchical structure. When copying occurs, new instances 
  of every link or category that are being copied are created</p>
<h3><a
name="rev">Reviews</a></h3>
<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>A link may contain user-written reviews associated with it. 
  When clicking Review next to a link, a link detailed record will be shown 
  containing a list of link reviews.</p>
<h4>Add or Edit Reviews</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Administrator can add a new review by pressing the Add Review 
  button in any link detailed review record. Administrator can also edit reviews 
  by clicking the Edit link under the specific review.  Administrator can change 
  the actual review text, date of the review and the user who submitted the review.</p>
<h4>Delete Review</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Administrator can delete any reviews by clicking the Delete 
  link under the specific review.</p>

<h4>Pending Categories</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Pending Categories screen allows the Administrator to view, 
  approve, and/or deny pending categories suggested by end users. The Select 
  All and Unselect All buttons allow for mass approvals/denials of categories.  
  Depending on the e-mail settings, In-link can automatically send out e-mails 
  for individual category approvals and denials upon adding them to the live database. 
  Depending on the e-mail settings in the configuration, approving a category 
  could send a custom e-mail message to the person who suggested it; mass approving 
  selected categories, by default, simply adds them to the live database without 
  sending out any messages. Denying a category allows you to send a custom e-mail 
  to the person who submitted it; mass deleting selected categories simply deletes 
  them from the pending list. The search, advanced search and sorting and ordering 
  view options will only display pending categories. </p>

<h4>Duplicate Links Check</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>The duplicate link check scans the current database looking 
  for duplicate links with or without the same name and displays them to the Administrator. 
  Editing the duplicate link will display all entries in the database with that 
  link. Links may be deleted as seen fit. You can perform administrative tasks 
  of editing and deleting for any links in the list.<br>

<h4>Duplicate User Email Check</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>This functionality allows Administrator to validate all users 
  in the system for the subject of duplicate e-mail addresses.  When found, the 
  users will be displayed in the format of a standard user list, allowing deleting 
  and disabling users with duplicate e-mail addresses.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Links Validation</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Links validation checks that every link within the database 
  points to an existing URL and is not a broken link. Links validation can be 
  a lengthy process that can take a significant time on a large database.  You 
  can perform any administrative tasks of editing and deleting for any links in 
  the list.<br>

<h3>Data Cleanup</h3>
<h4>Database Maintenance and Cleanup</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>Database Maintenance and Cleanup allows maintaining the integrity 
  of the database by conducting a system wide check of the dynamically calculated 
  values. For example, there are certain conditions (such as lost connection, 
  for example) when some of the dynamically calculated values (such as link and 
  categories counter) may become offset. The Database Maintenance and Cleanup 
  will recalculate those values and will reset them.  There is no need to run 
  Database Maintenance and Cleanup unless you notice that some of the dynamic 
  counters are showing incorrect values.</p>
<h2><a

  to the mailing list.  4) Editor  an editor that is granted access privileges 
  to administer designated categories.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>By default a newly created user has User permissions (regular 
  user allowed to use member services at the front-end).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Customization section of the Administration Panel can be used 
  to customize your copy of In-link.  It allows you to modify the layouts for 
  the front-end of the system through themes, change languages and date format 
  through the regional settings and extend the system functionality by including 
  additional modules.</p>
<h3><a
name="themes">Themes</a></h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>Themes represent the front-end layout (look and feel of your 
  system that the end users will see).  Themes are one of the strongest features 
  of In-link.  The entire front end is completely template-based, meaning that 
  the entire engine's look and its output can be modified, customized and integrated 
  into any web site. Themes are sets of template files and a cascading style sheet 
  file that can all be edited in any text editor or by using the In-links built-in 
  editor. The themes are located in <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>&quot;themes\&quot;</span> 
  directory in your In-link directory. You can download new themes from our web 
  site or add and modify your own. Just place them in their own directory under 
  <span

  Language sets are contained in the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>&quot;languages\&quot;</span> 
  directory.  The entire system output is located in centralized language files 
  that can be easily edited in any simple text editor or in built-in In-links 
  editor. You can easily modify any system messages in the sets or even create 
  your own language sets. You can even change the browser language encoding and 
  the date format for the entire system. Additional language sets are available

<h3><a
name="system">System</a></h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>This section allows the Administrator to modify vital system 
  settings. Normally, these settings are configured by the installation program 
  and do not need to be modified.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>General</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>These settings allow you to modify your general In-link settings.</p>
<h5>Site Name</h5>
<p class=MsoNormal>This field allows you to specify the name of the server where 
  In-link is installed.</p>
<h5>Site Address</h5>
<p class=MsoNormal>This field specifies the server where In-link is installed.  
  This is the information that you specified when you purchased In-link. You cannot 
  change this information and if you need to modify this field, please contact 
  In-link's customer support to reissue your license.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Database</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>In order for In-link to operate at all, it needs access to 
  a database already setup and running on the server.  Normally, the installation 
  script already configured this information so you dont have to update it unless 
  you would like In-link to operate on a different database. (It needs to be an 
  exact copy of the running database to prevent the program from crashing)</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span class=text>Use Persistent Connection to the database</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Note: Persistent connections require more server resources.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
background:#FFFFD9'> 
  <p class=warning><span class=hint>Please, exercise extreme caution when modifying 
    the database settings. Your copy of In-link may stop functioning if the values 
    are modified incorrectly.</span></p>
</div>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Session Control</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Without going into much of technical discussion of both methods, 
  cookies is probably the best mechanism to retain all of the end-user session 
  information. Persistent cookies allow In-link to store all of the user information 
  directly on the user computer for a certain time (specified by the cookie timeout 
  field).  When an In-link user returns to an In-link driven system, the system 
  will readily have all of their preferences available.  For example, if selected 
  a different language, when the user returns for the next time, the system will 
  automatically display everything in that language for that particular user.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>In-link is powerful system that allows end-users to customize 
  their preferences retained by In-link as part of their session information.  
  However, the HTTP protocol used on the web is stateless (each consecutive page 
  load is a separate request and the web server has no recollection if it comes 
  from the same user or not).  In order to retain user preferences, (such as language 
  selection, sorting or ordering preferences, etc.) In-link utilizes two methods 
  for doing that: cookies and GET method.  Each method has its own advantages 
  and disadvantages over each other and for the best results we recommend leaving 
  the session control at utilizing both methods.  (Our session control mechanism 
  intelligently relies upon both methods for session control, so if one method 
  fails, another method steps in and vice versa) </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The problem is that if cookies are disabled on the users computer 
  (some browsers do have them disabled by default due to privacy reasons), the 
  system will not be able to preserve the session information, even when going 
  from page to page within the system.  Thus, relying solely on cookies is not 
  reliable.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>In order to solve this problem, In-link utilizes a secondary 
  mechanism for keeping the state information alive  GET method. GET method involves 
  physically passing the session information from one page to another (every time 
  a user clicks a link or presses a button and is taken to a different page) as 
  a parameter.  This method is more reliable than cookies, however, it is not 
  persistent, meaning that if the user goes on to another site or closes their 
  browse, all of the session information gets lost.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>With that in mind, In-link utilizes a combination of both methods 
  to guarantee that the session information is preserved. Unless you have a specific 
  reason for doing so, we strongly recommend that you leave the system at its 
  default setting of utilizing both mechanisms.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
background:#FFFFD9'> 
  <p class=warning><span class=hint>Please, exercise extreme caution when changing 
    the session control settings.  If improperly set, THE entire system may stop 
    functioning correctly for the end users.</span></p>
</div>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Paths</h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>There are two paths that you need to know in order for In-link 
  to function properly.  Normally, the installation script already configured 
  this information so you dont have to update it unless you moved In-link to 
  a different location and would like to update the system path information.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span class=text>In-link Server Path</span></h5>
<p class=MsoNormal>The Server path is the actual path to the files on your server. 
  This is the path you would see when navigating to the In-link files on your 
  server ( Ex.: <span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>/home/user/public_html/inlink/</span> ). On Unix/Linux 
  you can see what this path is by typing in the command &quot;<span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'>pwd</span>&quot; in your shell 
  session window (Telnet) while located in the same directory where In-link is. 
</p>
<h5>URL Path</h5>
<p class=MsoNormal>The URL path is the path that you would see in your browser 
  address field; it is usually the URL path following your domain. (Ex.: for <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";'><a
href="http://www.yourserver.com/inlink"><span style='color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none;'>http://www.yourserver.com/inlink</span></a></span> the 
  URL path would be <span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";'>/inlink/</span>). </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='border:solid windowtext .5pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;
background:#FFFFD9'> 
  <p class=warning><span class=hint>Please, exercise extreme caution when modifying 
    the system paths. Your copy of In-link may stop functioning if the values 
    are modified incorrectly.</span></p>
  <p class=warning><span class=hint>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<h3><a name="search">Search</a></h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>This section allows Administrator to modify various search 
  settings, such as selecting which fields to search by, highlighting search results, 
  utilizing extended search, etc.</p>
<h4>General</h4>
<h5>Use Extended Search</h5>
<p class=MsoNormal>This option allows Administrator to utilize extended search 
  throughout the system.  Extended search allows for more accurate and more relevant 
  search results, especially, when dealing with search strings consisting of multiple 
  words.  The search results that are returned by the extended search are sorted 
  by relevancy.  For example, with a search string of three words, the first results 
  returned by the extended search will be the results containing all of three 
  words in exactly the same order. Next, the other results will contain the same 
  three words but in a different order following by the results with only two 
  or one words found from the original search string.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>While extremely powerful, extended search relies on helper 
  database tables that are created on the fly for the purpose of continuous data 
  manipulation (i.e. the search results are temporarily saved in the database 
  for the extended search optimization purposes).  The nature of the extended 
  search, however, may pose performance problems on slower servers or on servers 
  with multiple concurrent extended searches.</p>
<h5>Highlighting keys in the search results</h5>
<p class=MsoNormal>This option allows Administrator to specify the opening and 
  the closing HTML tag (or a CSS style) for marking key phrases within the search 
  results</p>
<h4>Simple Link Search </h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>This allows the Administrator to select the fields in the database 
  for links that will be included in the simple search.</p>
<h4>Simple Category Search </h4>
<p class=MsoNormal>This allows the Administrator to select the fields in the database 
  for categories that will be included in the simple search.</p>
