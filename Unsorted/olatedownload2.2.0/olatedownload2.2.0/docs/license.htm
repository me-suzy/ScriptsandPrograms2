PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENCE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE. BY INSTALLING, COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AND/OR YOUR COMPANY (COLLECTIVELY, "YOU") ARE ACCEPTING AND AGREEING WITH THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE. VARIOUS COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECT THE SOFTWARE. THIS AGREEMENT IS A LICENCE AGREEMENT THAT GIVES YOU LIMITED RIGHTS TO USE THE SOFTWARE AND NOT AN AGREEMENT FOR SALE OR FOR TRANSFER OF TITLE. THE AUTHOR RETAINS ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The author forbids, under any circumstances, the unauthorized reproduction of the Software or use of illegally obtained software. Making illegal copies of the Software is prohibited. Individuals who violate copyright law and software licensing agreements may be subject to criminal or civil action by the owner of the copyright. </p>
<p> <strong>1. LICENCE GRANT </strong><br>

<p><strong>2. SOFTWARE USAGE</strong></p>
<p> Licensee may download, install, setup and use the software. Any person or entity who obtains or uses a copy of the software under or through this Agreement agrees to be bound thereby. </p>
<p> <strong>3. OWNERSHIP </strong><br>
<br>
The software and related user documentation are protected under British, European and International copyright laws. All right, title, and interest in and to the software, including associated intellectual property rights, are and shall remain with Olate. This Agreement does not convey to Licensee an interest in or to the software, but only a limited right to use the software, revocable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>4. RESTRICTIONS</strong></p>
<p> Licensee may not use, copy, modify, or distribute the software (electronically or otherwise), or any copy, adaptation, transcription, or merged portion thereof, except as expressly authorized by this Agreement (see 6. Modification below) or through prior, written consent. Licensee may not alter, remove, or make less visible, in any way, the copyright notice(s) embedded in the software, including but not limited to, HTML generated pages and the source code files.</p>
<p><strong>5. DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>
<p> Distribution of the software from any location other than an official Olate site or an authorized mirror, in modified or non-modified form, is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6. MODIFICATION</strong></p>
<p> You are granted permission to make modifications to the software for your own use, under the following conditions: </p>
<ol>

<p> <strong>7. WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES </strong><br>

The software is being provided AS IS and Olate makes no warranty as to its use or performance. OLATE AND ITS ASSOCIATES DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS LICENSEE MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE SOFTWARE. OLATE AND ITS ASSOCIATES MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL OLATE OR ITS ASSOCIATES BE LIABLE TO LICENCEE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN OLATE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. <br>
<br>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or special damages, or the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so that all or some of the above limitations may not apply to all Licensees.<br>
<br>
<strong>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY </strong><br>
<br>
Neither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or data use. Our maximum liability for any damages whether in contract or tort will not exceed the fees which you have paid to us or are payable to us for this order, and if such damages result from your use of the Software or technical support, the liability shall be limited to the fees paid or payable for the Software or technical support. <br>
<br>
