      <blockquote> 
        <p>When this is selected to 'Yes', the script will update the TGP page 
          every time the page is refreshed. This is used for setting up the script 
          to make sure that everything looks ok. Once you are done and ready for 
          production, the demo mode should be set to 'No' so the update will happen 
          once a day.</p>

      <p><b><a name="numlist"></a>Limit number of galleries displayed</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Set this to limit the number of galleries that will get displayed. 
          If you are running the TGP as one big list, then whatever number you 
          set -- say 100 -- will show up. If you are running the site as separate 
          categories, then each category will have 100 galleries listed.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p><a name="dlength"></a><b>Description length</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This will set the number of characters that get displayed of the description. 
          This is useful if you have a limited amount of space on your site and 
          don't want the descriptions to wrap within a cell.</p>

      <p><b><a name="dupe"></a>Check for duplicate files during import?</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>With this setting turned to 'Yes', the script will check every gallery 
          before importing into the database to make sure that its not already 
          in there. If it is, it will reject the post and mark it as a 'Dupe'.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="pop"></a>Check for pop-up's on gallery import?</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>When set to 'Yes', the script will open each gallery before importing 
          into the database. If it finds a pop-up on the site, it will reject 
          the post and mark it as 'Pop'.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="pre"></a>Trade script prefix</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Whatever you put in this field will be added to the actual outgoing 
          link on the site before the gallery url. Example: if you were using 
          a trade script and added the following 'out.php?url=', your outgoing 
          link would look like this.... http://www.domain.com/out.php?url=http://www.gallery.com</p>
        <p><b>Note: You can list seperate trade script information for both Text 
          and Thumb links. Just in case you want to skim more on one or the other.</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="suf"></a>Trade script suffix</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Much like the prefix, this one will add info AFTER the url. If you 
          were using the two together, your link would look like this.... http://www.domain.com/out.php?url=http://www.gallery.com&amp;link=gal&amp;s=70&amp;first=1</p>
        <p><b>Note: You can list seperate trade script information for both Text 
          and Thumb links. Just in case you want to skim more on one or the other.</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="adminpass"></a>Reset Admin Password</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This will reset the admin password for the script. <b>Only check the 
          box and add info to the text field next to it if you want to change 
          the password.</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a name="html"></a><b>Update HTML template</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This is where you will change the way a link gets displayed on your 
          site. To make the link, you simply use straight HTML. There are also 
          several variables that you can use to make the link look the way you 
          want.<br>
          <br>
          %cat% = Category of post<br>
          %url% = Complete url to be put on the page. This will also include the 
          trade info links<br>
          %desc% = Description for post<br>
          %numpic% = Number of images that are in the post<br>
          %overurl% = This will display the raw URL. It can be used as part of 
          your onmouseover.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of a standard html template setup - </p>
        <p>%dis_date% %cat% - &lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma, Arial&quot; size=2&gt;&lt;A 
          HREF=&quot;%url%&quot; target=&quot;_tgp&quot;&gt;%desc%&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
        <p>This will produce a link that looks like the following - </p>
        <p>08-07 Amateurs - <a href="##">One Hot Amateur Posing Here</a></p>
        <p>The way the date above is formatted depends on how you configured it 
          in the admin area.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><a name="pnumlist"></a><br>
        <b>Limit number of Thumbs displayed</b></p>
      <p>This will set the total number of thumbnails that are to be displayed. 
        Be sure to do have the number you pick work with the number of columns 
        you specify. So, if you want to display 25 thumbs, you should pick 5 columns. 
        If you want to have 6 columns, you will need to either display 24 or 30 
        thumbs. That way the table ends up having the correct number of cells 
        in it.</p>
