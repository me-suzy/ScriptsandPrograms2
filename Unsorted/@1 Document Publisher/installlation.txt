Installation is simple. 

1) If necessary, change the path to Perl (#!/usr/bin/perl) pointing to
Perl's path in your environment (`which perl` from the command-line will tell
you what to use here).

2) Create a folder "docpublisher" under your root directory and chmod to 777.

3) Create a folder "images1" under the "docpublisher" folder and upload all images
that come with the zip file to this folder.

4) Create another folder "images2" and chmod to 777.

5) Open the script "docpublisher.cgi". Modify the variables at top portion. Upload
the script to the "docpublisher" folder and chmod to 755.

NOTE:
=====
1) To include a link, use the html tag <a href="http://.....">Link here</a>.
Always start the URL with http:// or broken link may be resulted.
