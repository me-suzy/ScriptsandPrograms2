This is where you maintain and organize your categories. 
The <B>Current Category</B> shows you where you are in your category hierarchy. The 
<B>Category Attributes</B> are the settings for the current category. 
<b>Note:</b> A <em>rootable</em> category is a category 
where you can post items to. If a category is not rootable, it's just a placeholder to navigate to 
the categories beneath it.
