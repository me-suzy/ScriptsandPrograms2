This tests your web server's ability to READ/WRITE/DELETE files in certain directory 
locations using the IIS anonymous user account (usually IUSR_MachineName). Only certain features 
require this kind of access. If you server shows problems here, but all the functions you have enabled 
work fine, then you do not need to be concerned about this.
