The Administrator should run this process on a periodic basis. This will 
remove uploaded images from the UserImages directory for ads that have been 
removed from the database. You do not need to run this if you do not have the image upload 
feature turned on. If you do have this feature turned on and do not run this, 
image files will continue to accumulate in the UserImages directory.
