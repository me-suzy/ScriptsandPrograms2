Here are the tips for the customers who purchased the enterprise edition.
Those tips will give you at least some ideas on template modification.
The important thing that you have to remember is that each template
contains variables. Those variables are declared as "{%varname%}.
Each variable represent an data output.

Template Tip:

a. General Template ()

- First of all, you should take a look at the default template and
  take notes of the variables. 

- Then, You can start to construct your new template. Don't forget
  to back up the default one. For example:

  browse_main.html   -> backup to -> browse_main.bak

  then save the newly template as -> browse_main.html

Note: don't forget to verify all the variables to make sure that the
new template contains all the variables from the default one.

b. Template for each category:

- In order to apply a template for a category. Here is what you need
  to do:

  1. Admin Panel > Category
  2. Click on the category to see its settings.
  3. Under the category setting, you will see
     "Select template: "
  4. Look for the pre-defined template. If you want to make a new template,
     Click on "New".
	
  5. Paste your HTML code in there. Please note that just like the general
     template modification, it contains "variables". You have to include
     the varialbles.

For example: ( from predefined template called "style1_redirect.txt" ). It locates
in 

  Admin Panel - > Category -> Click on one of the categories -> Select template
  -> Under "Select Category Template" you will see "style1_redirect.txt". Select it
  then click on edit. You will see:
   
   <script>
   document.location='{%var_browse_complete%}';
   </script>

   {%var_browse_complete%} represents the URL to the category complete display.
   
   The code in "style1_redirect.txt" will redirect that normal category to
   a complete category display.

Here are the variables you must know for the template category:

Those are the variables that exist in  browse_cat.html

{%var_browse_complete%} = the url the to category complete display
{%var_features%}        = Category features
{%var_span%}            = Display Pages
{%var_listings%}        = Article listings
{%var_cats%}            = Sub categories
{%url_php%}             = Nephp Script URL
{%tpl_template_url%}    = Template URL
{%var_browse_url%}      = Return to browse.php
{%tpl_nav%}             = Navigate bar
{%offset%}              = Off set variable
{%catid%}               = Current Category ID
{%booltp%}              = to tell the category, where it complete display or not

Please note that you have use the variables that locate in browse_cat.html for
template by category.

You have to go through the default template ( the ones come with the package )
to understand how the default template works before you start to define a new
template.

Good luck. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave us a message.
