            Except for the data files that have to be deleted and recreated by 
            the program, ALL files have been renamed so the older program can 
            remain until installation is proved.</p>
          <p>ListMerge has always created its own safe copies of E-Mail lists.</p>
          <p><b>Two new list formats have been added to v2.+</b><br>
            List &quot;formats&quot; are an E-Lists and ennyForms subscriber thing 
            where original lists can be created with extra subscriber/program 
            input for personalising merged mail-outs via PC or ListMerge. See 
            the new formats &quot;4&quot; and &quot;5&quot; below (<i>blue E-Lists 
            info box</i>).</p>
          <p>The lack of HTML code in the texts saving HTML box in the &quot;sending&quot; 
            window will cause the program to send only plain text e-mails OR all 
            can be overridden to send only HTML e-mails.</p>
          <p>It is expected that a site is tidy with all mail list saving programs 
            saving to the one directory (preferably secure as a sub of the true 
            cgi-bin). ListMerge is pointed to this directory and attempts to detect 
            the format of the lists it finds <b>with file name extensions matching</b> 
            those in the new<b> $elst_exten</b> variable. ListMerge then looks 
            for any <b>delimiters in those lists matching</b> the new <b>@seps</b> 
            array. </p>
          <p>A list with a delimiter matching the default <b>$sep</b> variable 
            between fields in the original list will be treated as an E-Lists 
            or ennyForms saved list with possible &quot;name&quot; and &quot;date&quot; 
            and &quot;htm&quot; fields saved with the &quot;address&quot;. Lists 
            with other delimiters from other porgrams will be recorded as &quot;address 
            only&quot; lists with the new format marker of &quot;<b>5</b>'. </p>
          <p>Plain address only lists will be recorded with the original (earlier 
            versions of ListMerge) format marker of &quot;<b>3</b>&quot;. These 
            marker values can be changed - but only <b>IF</b> really necessary.</p>
          <p>A marked list of &quot;3&quot; can be changed to &quot;5&quot; even 
            if the original list contains possible user &quot;htm&quot; fields 
            (E-Lists v2+ and ennyForms) to slightly speed up the mailing process 
            BUT only do this if the first fields of each record in the original 
            list are addresses!</p>
          <p>ListMerge v2+ allows the <b>sending of test mails</b> to the default 
            site address of one plain text letter and one HTML page formatted 
            letter - if the latter has been saved via the texts saving form.</p>
          <p><b> </b>All relevant files are supplied in one compressed .zip file 
            that includes the recommended directory structure. It is assumed that 
            the Zip file has been uncompressed to the root directory creating 
            the default directory structure included in the Zip file, and described 
            below. A utility to create the default recommended cgi-bin subdirectories, 
            file names, plus chmod permissions is included.</p>

          <p><font FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">ListMerge is designed to bulk mail to
    elists.cgi created e-mail lists, AND/OR basic address-only e-mail lists. All you need for
    the latter is the list(s) file name extension and directory path where all lists reside. </font></p>
          <p><font FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">ListMerge previously read information from the E-Lists config file and
    enable the additional merging of list member names and subscription dates - if those extra
    options were enabled in E-Lists. Now ListMerge attempts to detect the list type without reading the E-Lists config set up.</font></p>
          <p><font FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Which ever list types are used, it is assumed that all
    e-mail lists reside in one directory. By command, <b>ListMerge creates a copy of original
    lists</b> leaving the originals secure, <b>keeps track of addresses not yet mailed to</b> in a session, and allows for updating of new
    subscribers should any appear in the original lists before the current mail-out is
    completed (this latter option can be slow on very large lists).</font></p>
          <font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">
          <p>For each original e-mail list found on your site,
    three files are created. One is the above mentioned copy of the original, and another is
    the data and texts associated with each list. Therefore the <b>body text</b>, a <b>header
    or introduction</b> text, <b>signature</b> text, the '<b>from</b>' address, the '<b>Subject</b>'
    line, and an <b>HTML page</b> can be created differently for each list. <i>ie</i> one might be in reference to price list
    upgrades with a 'from' address for sales@yourdomain.name and another for a monthly
    newsletter 'from' editor@yourdomain.name.... blah blah.</p>
          <p>Once the mailing of all addresses for any
    list is completed and another later mail-out is ready, <i>ie</i> once a month or when a new
    upgrade is to be announced, the ListMerge copy of addresses can be recreated (over
    written) with the latest version of the original list (with new additions or deletions).</p>
          <p><b><font COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">NOTE</font></b><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">: <b><u>Very</u> large mass mail-outs</b> should only be performed
    by a dedicated mail server. If your lists become so successful, consider leasing one for your business. The basic cgi methods of sending mail are inefficient for <u>very</u> large
    mail-outs on shared servers, and some programs <b>including ListMerge</b> offer an <b>option to send mail in
    blocks</b> to reduce the load on the Mail Server of your Hosting service.</font></p>
          <p><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica"><b>You control the mail-out quantity by 'batch' sending</b><br>
            This simply means that
    once a nominated number of addresses have been mailed to, the &quot;Send&quot; page
    reappears ready for the next batch to be sent thus allowing the Mail Server CPU to perform
    other tasks in between. This will help prevent you from being banned by the host service (<i>reports have confirmed this happens and people welcome the ListMerge batch option, but all it takes is contact with your host and they will mostly respond positively with perhaps a suggested &quot;batch' figure</i>).</font></p>
          <p>Because ListMerge records addresses sent and those not sent (ready) per session,
    if the server is very slow you can return anytime later and continue where you left off
    with the next 'batch' without having to remain logged on while the full list is exhausted. If the program is &quot;time terminated&quot; by the server - <b>the most common reason for mailing crashes</b> - the last successful mailed address is recorded allowing you to continue again with possibly only one address sent twice.</p>

Most servers have timed &quot;life&quot; limits on CGI programs primarily for the very good reason of trapping &quot;runaway&quot; programs. True, a mail server might be (usually is) very busy and slow in time slicing the many many accesses, but a good thing about Unix &quot;SENDMAIL&quot; is that it queues mail if the actual mail server is busy or even down. Therefore whatever the reason, terminated CGI is the biggest problem, followed by browser time out if no program response is detected (while it is working).</font></p>
                <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">There are programs that use a &quot;child&quot; process to quickly refresh your browser, BUT the above still applies to the child process and if it crashes/is terminated you have NO way of knowing!!

As ListMerge requires another program to harvest the subscribers addresses and those programs often have that option included, list viewing would be just a duplication of management facilities. </font></p>

          <p>
            Wherever your lists are situated <b>ListMerge creates safe copies of the originals</b> and works the mailing from them. ListMerge has the very rare but immensely popular facility of allowing you to send only the number e-mails you think/know your mail server can handle at one time. Then the program is ready to send the next batch and so forth until the current mail out is complete. </p>
          <p>Because ListMerge keeps track of which addresses have been sent and which are ready to send, during a mail out the list copy can be refreshed with new arrivals without upsetting the &quot;sent&quot; tracking. With the &quot;batch&quot; method employed, addresses canot receive extra copies because the program knows where it left off. You have to reset the list when later ready to perform another mail out!</p>
          <p>Each mail list Listmerge copies is acompanied by a data file that holds the letter information and texts and/or HTM page sent to each address in the list. The &quot;sending and editing&quot; admin page includes areas for entry of the From Address, Subject wording, Organisation name if desired, Header portion of the letter, Main body portion of the letter, Signature portion of the letter, AND a complete HTML page. <b>An unsubscribe URL</b> should now be included by you </p>
          <p><font color="#FF0000">NOTE</font>: <b>LnkinLite</b> is ideal for creating permanent or temporary &quot;named&quot; hyperlinks  that can be quickly created, generated and copied into your mail letter. This way not only subscribers can be given a special hidden html page to view, but responses can be judged by LnkinLite's link-click counting feature.</p>
          <p>Already described above, if ListMerge detects the E-Lists file format when mail lists are saved with the subscribers name and subscription date then ListMerge can add that extra info to each letter by a simple process of you including field markers in the head/body/signature/HTML areas of the letter.</p>
          <p>And as already mentioned each list accessed by Listmerge retains its own letter data file, so at the next mail out the new body text can be edited from the previous and perhaps the head and signature sections left as is.... <i>designed with the user in mind</i>.</p>
          <p>Resetting or refreshing of each list is perfomed on the first admin page. Each list name is dsiplayed and from there the individual letter data and &quot;batch mailing&quot; form is accessed.</p>
          <p>The program has an in built password
    administration page for changing your desired GMTime zone, admin page access password,
    and a further encrypted password authorising editing changes and mail-outs. Therefore, even
    if another person discovers your 'access' password in the browsers cache (all generated pages use the no-cache meta-tag), they cannot
    change or send any data, and if remote from your server loft, the prefered remote time is reflected in all output AND now <b>displays your local time in the visible e-mail header in standard email time format</b>!!</p>
          <p>The cgi-bin directory and any
    subdirectories of it should be protected from user access by system default, so they are
    an ideal place for maximum security (<i>nothing can be done if your server is hacked into</i>).
    the programs can access info files, but files cannot be accessed from outside.</p>

            <font size="3" face="arial,geneva,helvetica" color="#000099">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES in DETAIL</font></b></p>
          <p><b>GMT TIME ZONE reference</b><i> - set via ListMerge pages.</i><b><br>
    </b>As with www.dtp-aus.com, Hosting services are used now &quot;remote&quot; from ones local ISP service. Normally this means that all of our
    scripts etc report dates and times are different to that of our local access points, ie our
    home locality from where we view our sites. To overcome this I use a Perl facility that
    allows us to use (G)reenwich (M)ean (T)ime with an offset reference reporting in my local
    time and date. One of the perl &quot;require&quot; files, 'gmtset.pl', contains a variable
    name - <font FACE="courier new,courier">$gmtPlusMinus</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica"> - whose value MUST be set for your local GMT offset. I live
    in a world time zone 15 hours ahead of that of my Host Servers. Therefore, when I set the
    variable to 36000 (</font><font COLOR="#990000" FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">+10hrs</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica"> = Melbourne Australia GMTime), the lists record, and I
    view, all dates and times relevant to my locality irrespective of where my Hosting service
    is. With this method I can move my Domain and the results would not change.</font></p>
          <p>ListMerge now takes advantage of the GMT method for all visible e-mail headers too.</p>
          <p><b>Most home / business computer systems have the GMT value listed in the system clock control panel... <i>simple</i>.</b></p>
          <p>The calculation is also simple. Your local GMT
    time, multiplied by 60, and multiplied by 60 again. ie 10X60X60. Therefore my variable
    entry is &quot;<font FACE="courier new,courier">$gmtPlusMinus = 36000</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">&quot;. If your GMT zone is a negative value, simply include
    a negative value ie &quot;</font><font FACE="courier new,courier">$gmtPlusMinus = -36000</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">&quot;. If you want the dates/times to be the same as the
    servers, simply enter the value for the servers GMT zone.</font></p>
          <p><b>US AND BRITISH DATE reporting<br>
    </b>ListMerge can save the e-mail address submission time using either the US mm/dd/yyyy
    format, or the BRITISH dd/mm/yyyy format. In the configuration file, 'lmrgeset.pl', you
    will find a variable named <font FACE="courier new,courier">$dtUS</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">. Leaving this variable value as null, ie '</font><font
    FACE="courier new,courier">$dtUS = &quot;&quot;</font>' will cause the scripts to use &quot;dd/mm/yyyy&quot;. Setting this variable to
    '<font FACE="courier new,courier">$dtUS = &quot;1&quot;</font>' will force 'mm/dd/yyyy'.</p>
          <p><b>CHECKING FOR CORRECT REFERRERS</b> - <font color="#CC0000">this can block even YOU...<b> &quot;Bad Referrer&quot;</b></font><b><br>
    </b>This option in the 'lmrgeset.pl' file allows you create an &quot;array&quot; of Domain
    names and IP numbers that lstmrge.cgi will respond positively to. By including the
    acceptable calls to your pages and/or your IP#, ie 'www.yourdomain.com' and
    yourdomain.com' you effectively stop improper additions to your lists from distant sites
    (entries are only accepted from pages on your site, not remote copies of your pages
    elsewhere <i>&#150; they try all the time</i>). The array is named &quot;<font
    FACE="courier new,courier">@referers</font>&quot;
    and you simply (MUST) enter your preferences in place of the examples. NOTE: The brackets,
    quotes and commas enclosing each item must be included else an error will occur, ie:</p>

    not the IP#. If your scripts are called from the cgi-bin of a domain that is housing your
    site and your specific scripts are in that domains cgi-bin, you may have to include the
    cgi-bin also in relevant urls ie: &quot;ahost.net/cgi-bin/&quot;.</p>

    each line in the config files. These MUST remain else an error will occur.</font></p>
          <p><b>PATHS TO FILES ACCESSED BY SCRIPTS<br>
    </b>The defaults used in the ' lmrgeset.pl ' file assume you will place these files in
    your cgi-bin and add directories to it called &quot;sets&quot; and &quot;mrglists&quot;.
    If you have to use other directory names, or your &quot;cgi-bin&quot; has a different
    name, then you will have to change the paths accordingly; &quot;cgi-yourdomain&quot; is
    not uncommon. There are three path types that can be used at various times with in a
    program or script. A full URL is the same as the path you enter in your browsers address
    box when typing in a site path that you wish to go to: ie 'http://www.wooz.com/harry.htm'.
    A relative path is a path description to a source, relative to the directory of the
    program, file or web page that is calling it: ie &quot;jimbo.htm&quot; means that the file
    being called should be in the same directory. &quot;inone/jimbo.htm&quot; refers to a file
    that should be in a directory named 'inone' which is a subdirectory within the current
    directory, and &quot;../jimbo.htm&quot; means that the file should be in a directory one
    above the current directory, and &quot;../../jimbo.htm&quot; is in a directory two above
    etc.</p>
          <p>For some servers, a simple relative path
    called by a script is unacceptable, so an absolute path relative to the sites root
    directory must be called. There are also variations to this description but &quot;<font
    FACE="courier new,courier">web/yourdomain/yourdirectory/jimbo.htm</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">&quot; (example only) is a relative root path description
    that works on many servers. Another root path is &quot;</font><font
    FACE="courier new,courier">/home/yourdomain/www/yourdirectory/jimbo.htm</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">&quot;. If you have trouble with accessing the default
    simple relative paths included in the 'lmrgeset.pl' file, try the root reference ie &quot;</font><font
    FACE="courier new,courier">web/yourdomain/cgi-bin/mrglists/mrgml.pw</font><font
    FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica">&quot; etc. If this is still a problem, look in any
    installed scripts on your server for a reference, or contact your hosting support staff.</font></p>
          <p><b><i>NOTE</i></b>: If you have problems,
    double check ALL permission's (below) before changing the default paths, unless you know
    in advance what the paths should be, <b>and reload files to double check that you used
    ASCII transfer mode for all text files</b>.</p>
          <p><b>&quot;SENDMAIL&quot; MAIL PROGRAM server path</b> <font
    FACE="courier new,courier">$mailprog<br>
    </font>Similar to the Perl program path, this
    path has to be known for ListMerge to send submitted mail. If you do not know what it is
    or cannot find reference to in other installed scripts, ask your Host service support
    staff - <b>the utility &quot;testbin.cgi&quot; may report this path for you</b>.<br>
            The default is <font FACE="courier new,courier">$mailprog =
    &quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;;</font></p>
          <p><b>ADMIN Password </b>$adminword_pth<br>
    The file path relative to the script that will be created when you create an Admin
    Password. DO NOT edit this file &#150; the new password will be encrypted. When you first
    start the script successfully from a form using the Access Password, create a new Admin
    password immediately via the 'passwords' page link to secure your data from visitors. The
    current password will be nothing (null) and you enter the new word twice to be sure. Once
    accepted you have to enter the admin password in the editing forms next to the submit
    buttons whenever you try to edit any options.</p>
          <p><b>GMT Path </b><font
    FACE="courier new,courier">$gmt_pth</font><br>
    When you edit the GMT zone value from the passwords admin page, the script needs to know
    the path to the gmtset.pl file. The default is the &quot;sets&quot; sub directory and file
    name relative to the scripts directory.</p>
          <p><b>CONFIGURATION Path </b><font
    FACE="courier new,courier">$cnfg_pth</font><br>
    When you edit any configuration values or data files from the admin pages, the script
    needs to know the path to the 'lmrgeset.pl' file. The default is the &quot;sets&quot; sub
    directory and file name relative to the scripts directory. <font color="#CC0000">The &quot;sets&quot; directory is used by almost ALL dtp-aus.com programs and will have even more significance in the future</font>.</p>
          <p><b>The DATA FILES DIRECTORY </b><font
    FACE="courier new,courier">$mrgdatdir_pth</font><br>
    This is the directory path (not file) for the files created when copies of the lists are
    created or updated, and data files are created or amended. The default is
    &quot;mrglists&quot;.</p>
          <p><font FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>DEFAULT MAIL ADDRESS </b><font

          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>INCLUDED or REQUIRED FILES<br>
    </b>The Perl language allows the inclusion of extra files containing libraries of commonly
    accessed sub routines or common lists of script variables etc. The script lstmrge.cgi
    &quot;require&quot;s several such files. One includes a variable used by the date/time
    routines and another contains script variables that you need to adjust before
    installation. changeable program defaults are accessed by the admin pages. If you use other dtp-aus.com / HostingNet programs, I have included the GMT reference variable
    in a separate file as used by all my scripts on dtp-aus.com. If I need to change this
    common variable for daylight savings or domain moves etc, then I only have to change one
    file, not many. The GMT value can be set simply via the admin page.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b><font color="#CC0000">ListMerge has ONE main requirement for names of original lists that it copies</font></b>. They <b>MUST NOT</b> contain an hyphen character &quot;<b>-</b>&quot;, also called the &quot;minus sign&quot;.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>SAMPLE FILES</b><br>
    Once the script is uploaded and runs for the first time, setting the password(s) will also
    test the installation. Then alter and ASCII upload the sample files I have included into the &quot;mailfrms&quot; directory. &quot;<b>mytest.elf</b>&quot; etc would represent an e-mail address
    list. The extensions must match those of lists you are using (and set in the config
    file). Place these sample lists in your
    E-MAIL LISTS DIRECTORY. DO NOT manually create any data files in the &quot;mrglists&quot; directory as was possible in previous versions</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>CHANGE THE SAMPLES</b><br>
    If there are already some mail addresses, so <b>before uploading</b>, change the
    addresses in the sample files to yours. If you have multiple or unlimited email
    address names, enter several bogus names (ie fred@yourdomain.nme and bill@yourdomain.nme
    etc) OR just repeat the same one in each record.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b><font color="#CC0000">NOTE</font></b>: It is common-sense to aslo ALWAYS add your self to all real mail lists so you will receive and see just what your subscribers are getting!!</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>USING THE SAMPLES</b><br>
    Click on the radio button next to &quot;mytest&quot; listed in the first form, and click
    on the form button to take you to the Editing and Sending page for that list. You should
    see a screen like the second sample html page. </font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Create some texts (garbage will do), from address, subject line, add some HTML code etc and save the data. Use the &quot;TEST&quot; form to send your self a test letter of plain and HTML letters. If all goes well, set the &quot;Batch Number&quot; to 2 or 3,
    enter your admin password and click on the form button. If all goes well the script will
    find, talk to and send 2 or three e-mails to you (because the list contain your addresses). If they arrive without error then all should have
    been installed correctly (the time it takes for mail to arrive to yourself can be instant
    or minutes - this depends entirely on the Host Mail Server and Receiving Mail Server). Now you can send another two
    to check that the numbers displayed are incrementing/decreasing correctly.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">There are four simple test texts supplied you can copy and paste into the text saving box for each test list you want to use. They are not brain intensive but will do for test purposes.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Depending on the traffic pressures on the
    Host Server, and to some degree whether they have a separate server for e-mail, you might
    have to wait a minute for just one e-mail to be sent whereas at other times it will be
    quicker even if you are sending fifty at once etc.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">When all have been sent and received, try
    changing the texts and successfully saving changes several times. Close the window and
    come back a few minutes later and view the edit/send page again to make sure all changes
    appear as you would expect. DON'T forget you have to refresh a list with the first page &quot;<b>New</b>&quot; option to start again once a mail-out is complete.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">You can try the above with all the lists as most have different formats and this will check the ListMerge parsing of the originals.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">On the left of the second form on the first page are the last counted number of subscribers (recounts every time the first page is accessed). When the list has changed (subscribed to or UN-Subscribed to) the counted number will appear in red. This will indicate changes during a mail-out too (if batches are used) allowing you to use the &quot;<b>u/d</b>&quot; update option that will add new addresses to the current ListMerge list from the master (but not remove deleted ones). For very large lists this can be a bit slow so perhaps only use this if many addresses have been added to the original master list before a mailout is complete.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>DELETING</b><br>
            Should a mail lists data files are not needed any more then the &quot;delete&quot; option can be used. THIS WILL ONLY DELETE all ListMerge data files and NOT touch the original list IF it still exists.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>THE &quot;BOX WIDTH&quot; OPTION</b><br>
    When creating your own texts (header, body and signature), you can create long lines by
    simply typing and only hitting the enter key for a change of paragraph (hitting the enter
    key twice). However you might have noticed over time that many received e-mails are preset
    for easy reading with formatted narrow line widths. This is quite an important issue if
    you want the e-mails to be received well by all recipients, because many e-mail programs
    only have small viewing windows AND many people still using 640X480 resolution video can
    only read short lines without horizontal scrolling.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">As a simple guide you can preset for your
    own preference, I have included a variable &quot;box width&quot; (40 to 66 characters)
    that helps by allowing you to hit the enter key just once as your lines approach the right
    hand window limit, forcing the lines to wrap with easy visual control. ListMerge will
    detect single and multiple hidden enter key characters and send your texts accordingly.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>SIMPLE PREVIEW</b><br>
            Also included is the simple mono spaced
    sample view of the combined texts as they will be sent, displayed below the editing boxes,
    and this preview can be switched off if so desired.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>HTML ENTRY BOX</b><br>
            The HTML entry box is for pasting a complete HTML page and saving with the plain text options also. The program will detect, from E-Lists and ennyForms subscriber lists, an &quot;htm&quot; field the user has selected to accept HTML formatted list mail-outs. Should there not be any message box text OR the &quot;Use ALL HTML&quot; button has been selected then every letter will actually be an HTML page.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">If there is no HTML text then only the plain text message etc will be sent.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>HTML PAGES</b><br>
            Be sensible creating HTML pages for transmission. Make all hyperlinks FULL URLs. Any images included must also contain their FULL URL back to your site (remembering that images are useless when viewed off-line).... in fact use NO or as few images as possible. NEVER use SSI pages - they just don't work remotely! Make the page neat, informative and do not try to impress with heaps of nested tables - think file size.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b><font color="#CC0000">NOTE</font></b>: The merging field markers appearing above the message box can be included in the HTML pages as well as the message, header, signature boxes; BUT if using wysiwyg editors then you may have to manually change ISO characters (&amp;lt; and &amp;gt;) to the hard coded &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; characters. <i>See the supplied simple sample htm page text.</i></font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>QUICKEST MAILING</b><br>
            Probably the quickest mailing will be performed with a standard address only list, format marked to &quot;5&quot;, and with the &quot;No MERGING&quot; option box ticked. This will all avoid some of the programs logic checking..... BUT make sure the merging field markers do not exist in the texts because they will not be parsed / replaced and the subscribers will wonder what the heck! they mean.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">The &quot;<b>Stay Alive</b>&quot; button may or may not help if you experience too many Browser Time-outs. With this option selected the program attempts to send back a single invisible character every 50 letters. <b>Please give us feedback on this and other options of v2.+</b> as this is a very different program than the earlier versions and it would be appreciated.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">That's just about it. Repeatedly reset
    (using the &quot;new&quot; radio button again) and send the sample addresses to yourself
    until you feel confident, and then create the ListMerge copies and data files for any real
    e-mail lists you have, ready for transmission. If you see the displayed number of records
    on the left of each original e-mail list name appear in bold (view sample html), you will
    know that the list has received new additions since you last updated the copies because
    the totals will be different. If a mail-out is not yet complete you can select the second
    radio button (u/d) to add only those new additions <b>without resetting the list</b> - if
    you would like to include them in that current mail-out.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>NOTE</b>: <font color="#CC0000">When a list is renewed
    (via a &quot;<b>new</b>&quot; radio button), all addresses are reset to the 'not sent' state, <b>and doing
    this before a mail-out is finished</b> will cause multiple e-mails to be sent to many
    recipients with possible nasty comments and requests for un-subscribing! We all hate what
    appears to be mass spamming. <b>The &quot;update&quot; buttons allow safe inclusion</b> of newly added addresses during a mail-out session <i>ie between batch sending</i>.<a name="post"></a></font></font></p>

          <p><b>THE PATH TO PERL<br>
    </b>At the top of each perl script (and must remain as the first line) is a default path
    to the Perl program on your host server. This can vary slightly between UNIX servers. If
    you have problems running the scripts, check with your host support staff about the
    correct path described in this line. The default entry is &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot; and another common variation is &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;.
    In Perl scripts the hash sign &quot;<b>#</b>&quot; character comments out the code on a
    line starting with this character. <b>Here it has a special meaning</b> to Perl and MUST
    remain. Check with other installed scripts also if you do not know what this line should
    look like.</p>
          </font>
          <p><font FACE="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2"><b>SCRIPT and FILES PERMISSIONS<br>
    </b>Each list copy must be given read and write permissions (chmod 766). The directory
    that they are placed in (mrglists) will also need read and write permissions. Either read
    and write chmod 766 (r+w) or possibly chmod 777 (r+w+x) will work - try the first before
    the latter. The &quot;sets&quot; directory and the ?.set files in it must also be given
    the same permissions as the &quot;mrglists&quot; directory and files.</font></p>
          <font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">
          <p><b>UP LOADING FILES (Posting)<br>
    </b>The script must be given chmod 755 read and execute permissions (r+x).</p>
          <p>CGI-BIN permissions are set by the server
    and no attempt should be made to change them. Should you have to use another directory,
    AND your server allows the execution of Perl CGI scripts in other directories, then that
    directory should be set with read and execute permissions - chmod 755 (r+x).</p>
          <p>By far the biggest problems faced when
    installing scripts are firstly the file transport encoding used and secondly the
    permissions settings set for both files and new directories. Bitmap images must be sent to
    the server using the &quot;Binary&quot; protocol. Text files, ie html pages, CGI SCRIPTS
    and require files, MUST be sent in &quot;ASCII&quot; format. Failure to do this will
    result in a server failing to recognise and execute the scripts. Although often referred
    to as programs, scripts must be compiled before they do anything. As an example, files
    with the .EXE extension on programs that are installed on Wintel machines are pre-compiled
    binary executable programs. Perl scripts on the other hand are compiled in memory by Perl
    each time before they can be executed. The script (text) must be in ASCII text format for
    the interpreter to be able to read it.</p>

          <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Try installing and running this script first. It will report success or failure when creating the files/directories and prove the correctness of your Perl Path", plus indicate that the default relative paths will work OK. If the default urls/paths are not used, then you will have to change them first.</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">

To use it, make sure the "Perl Path" at the top of the script is correct. <font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE</b></font>: the default Dir/File permissions are set to 766. Change these values to 777 if your site so requires BEFORE running the script. If running the script is successful, you only have to FTP your supplied files over the new empty ones. (note: for security reasons, makedir does NOT prepare an empty file for the cgi scripts, you must upload them (as ascii) and set chmod 755 your self)

          <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Once run, delete the file immediately because it has no input protection and could be run again by some low-life wanting to cause mischief. </font></p>
          <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">If by chance you select the wrong values and you are locked out of directories, simply change the chmod values and re-run.
</font></p>
          <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">So!
Place "makedir.cgi" in your cgi-bin directory and chmod 755 (7=r+w+x, 5=r+x).
Then run from a browser command line, ie:
http://www.yourdomain.path/cgi-bin/makedir.cgi
