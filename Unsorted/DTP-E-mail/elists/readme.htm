        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><i>History...<br>
          </i>E-Lists was first released late 1998 with the dtp-aus.com program 
          &quot;ListMerge&quot; soon following in 1999. Because the two programs 
          were separate, E-Lists harvesting e-mail addresses both for PC download 
          AND Web based mailing <i>and</i> ListMerge capable of mail-merging E-Lists 
          and other address lists to e-mail mail outs &quot;in batches&quot;, 
          both programs gained a wide support group of users very quickly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">During the first half 
          of 2000 E-Lists was withdrawn from international availability (for Aus 
          only) and was to be replaced by an advanced &quot;Pro&quot; version. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">The local version eventually 
          received some further enhancements and an admin program much larger 
          than previous as a result of a complete rewrite. Continued requests 
          for the previous version brought about what is essentially a re-release 
          of free-to-use E-Lists - E-Lists 2.2; which will still eventually be 
          followed by the advanced Pro version.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Because it is a rewritten 
          program I ask for your support when assessing the program. It has been 
          withheld several times and extensively tested.... but a few little &quot;niggles&quot; 
          may be found.</font></p>

              is written as a separate program for mass mail outs and is designed 
              to make use of the E-Lists personalised address lists formats -

        </table>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>Before installation</b> 
          a little bit of planning should be applied... what is the file name 
          extension required for your list names, which directory do you want 
          to save the lists to, and what &quot;field separator&quot; (delimiter) 
          do you prefer. These options are set up in the config file &quot;elistset.pl&quot;. 
          <br>
          <b>NOTE</b>: if using ennyForms, ListMerge, or VizBook, you will have 
          already decided what these values should be. </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>UNIQUE <font color="#CC0000">FORM 
          REDISPLAY</font></b><br>
          E-Lists 2.2+ retains the original method of redisplaying a generated 
          form containing the users input when address or missing input errors 
          occur. This is far better for user interaction than having to use a 
          &quot;Back Arrow&quot; to correct mistakes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"> <b>ACCESS ADMIN FIRST!</b><br>
          Once all files are installed you should access the admin pages via the 
          supplied &quot;<b>webmster.html</b>&quot; page. This page contains an 
          &quot;ACCESS&quot; password form. If the @referers array in the config 
          file is edited correctly you and others will only be able to access 
          the admin pages via this form ONLY ON YOUR SITE - not remote copies 
          of the form EVEN on YOUR own PC or a browser command line.<br>
          <b>NOTE</b>: There are <b>TWO program passwords</b>; one to &quot;ACCESS&quot; the program and allow various windows to then open securely, and the other for &quot;ADMIN Editing&quot; - encrypted via an admin form!
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>NEW TO VERSION 2.2+..... 
          ALLOWED LISTS</b><br>
          Once in the main admin page you will be presented with a number of program 
          defaults that need checking/editing AND a section for creating &quot;ALLOWED 
          LISTS&quot; data files. This is a major change on previous versions. 
          Now a list cannot be subscribed to UNLESS activated as an &quot;allowed&quot; 
          list. Allowed lists can be deactivated at any time without deleting 
          the actual list of addresses.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Amongst other things 
          this new method of allowed lists removes accessible information from 
          the forms regarding each list, and if &quot;referrer checking&quot; 
          is switched off bogus lists cannot be created remotely.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>Double Address Input 
          Checking </b><br>
          <b>Each FORM</b> can contain a second e-mail address entry box enabling 
          a &quot;double input check&quot; similar to the familiar <i>enter twice</i> 
          password checking methods used on many forms. This option can be used 
          to reduce honest mistakes entering addresses!</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>Each FORM</b> (not 
          list) can be easily configured to tell the program to use YOUR OWN &quot;thanx&quot; 
          or result page <i>ie</i> an often used method is to snap the program 
          back to the originating forms URL!</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>Each FORM</b> (not 
          list) can be easily configured to tell the program to replace any &quot;Back 
          Arrow&quot; comments with &quot;<b>CLOSE Window</b>&quot; comments should 
          that form be used <b>in a pop-up window</b>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>ADMIN HELP</b><br>
          The main admin page activates a reasonably detailed pop-up HELP WINDOW 
          for all options on the main admin page, and brief comments regarding 
          the second &quot;list specific&quot; admin page that can be accessed 
          once a list is &quot;allowed&quot; (second page options also briefly

        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>GMT TIME ZONE reference<br>
          </b>As with www.dtp-aus.com, Hosting services are being used now that 
          are &quot;remote&quot; from ones local ISP service. Normally this means 
          that all of our scripts etc report dates and times different to that 
          of our local access points, ie our home locality from where we view 
          our sites. To overcome this I use a Perl facility that allows us to 
          use (G)reenwich (M)ean (T)ime with an offset reference reporting in 
          my local time and date. One of the &quot;sets&quot; files, 'gmtset.pl', 
          contains a variable name - $gmtPlusMinus - whose value MUST be set for 
          your local GMT offset. I live in a world time zone 15 hours ahead of 
          that of my Host Servers. Therefore, when I set the variable to 36000 
          (GMT+10hrs), the lists record, and I view, all dates and times relevant 
          to my locality irrespective of where my Hosting service is. With this 
          method I can move, or my host could move, my Domain server and the results 
          should not change.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Most home / business computer 
          systems have the GMT value listed in the <b>system clock control panel</b>... 
          <i>simple</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">The manual calculation 
          is simple. Your local GMT time, multiplied by 60, and multiplied by 
          60 again. ie 10X60X60. Therefore my variable entry is &quot;$gmtPlusMinus 
          = 36000&quot;. If your GMT zone is a negative value, simply include 
          a negative value ie &quot;$gmtPlusMinus = -36000&quot;. If you want 
          the dates/times to be the same as the servers, simply enter the value 
          for the servers GMT zone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>US AND BRITISH DATE 
          reporting<br>
          </b>E-Lists can save the e-mail address submission time using either 
          the US mm/dd/yyyy format, or the BRITISH DD/mm/yyyy format. In the configuration 
          file, 'elistset.pl', you will find a variable named $dtUS. Leaving this 
          variable value as null, ie '$dtUS = &quot;&quot;' will cause the scripts 
          to use &quot;DD/mm/yyyy&quot;. Setting this variable to '$dtUS = &quot;1&quot;' 
          will force 'mm/DD/yyyy'.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>CHECKING FOR CORRECT 
          REFERRERS<font color="#CC0000"> EVEN YOURS</font><br>
          </b>This option in the 'elistset.pl' file allows you create an &quot;array&quot; 
          of Domain names and IP numbers that elists.cgi will respond positively 
          to. By including the acceptable calls to your pages and/or your IP#, 
          ie 'www.yourdomain.com' and yourdomain.com' you effectively stop improper 
          additions to your lists from distant sites (<b><font color="#CC0000">entries 
          are only accepted from LINKS/FORMS ON your site, not remote copies of 
          your pages elsewhere OR browser command lines</font> </b> <i>&#150; 
          they try all the time</i>). The array is named &quot;@referers&quot; 
          and you simply (MUST) enter your preferences in place of the examples. 
          NOTE: The brackets, quotes and commas enclosing each item must be included 
          else an error will occur, ie:</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">('www.yourdomain.com','yourdomain.com','000.000.000.000',). 
          Leave out the IP# if you do not have a true domain name with a static 
          IP#. &quot;www.ahost.net/mysite/&quot; etc will also work for second 
          level site calls etc. If your scripts are called from the cgi-bin of 
          a domain that is housing your site and your specific scripts are in 
          that domains cgi-bin, you will have to include the cgi-bin also ie: 
          &quot;ahost.net/cgi-bin/&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">At this point I will 
          bring your <b>attention</b> to the semi colons ( <b>; </b>) appearing

          an error will occur.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>PATHS TO FILES ACCESSED 
          BY SCRIPTS<br>
          </b>The defaults used in the ' elistset.pl ' file assume you will place 
          these files in your cgi-bin and add directories to it called &quot;sets&quot;, 
          &quot;elistdat&quot; (with sub dirs also), and &quot;maillists&quot;. 
          If you have to use other directory names, or your &quot;cgi-bin&quot; 
          has a different name, then you will have to change the paths accordingly; 
          &quot;cgi-yourdomain&quot; is not uncommon. There are two path types 
          that can be used at various times with in a program or script. A <b>relative</b> 
          path (preferred and easiest to use) is a path description to a source, 
          <u>relative</u> to the directory <u>of the program script</u>: ie &quot;jimbo.htm&quot; 
          means that the file being called should be in the same directory. &quot;inone/jimbo.htm&quot; 
          refers to a file that should be in a directory named 'inone' which is 
          a subdirectory within the current directory, and &quot;../jimbo.htm&quot; 
          means that the file should be in a directory one above the current directory, 
          and &quot;../../jimbo.htm&quot; is in a directory two above etc. </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">A full URL is the same 
          as the path you enter in your browsers address box when typing in a 
          site path that you wish to go to: ie 'http://www.wooz.com/harry.htm'. 
          A relative URL is as above for paths BUT relative to the html page!</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Relative paths should 
          NOT begin with a forward slash. Absolute paths SHOULD begin with a forward 
          slash! </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">For some servers, a 
          simple relative path called by a script is unacceptable, so an <b>absolute</b> 
          path relative to the sites root directory must be called. There are 
          also variations to this description but &quot;web/yourdomain/yourdirectory/jimbo.htm&quot; 
          (example only) is an absolute root path description that works on many 
          servers. Another root absolute path is &quot;/home/yourdomain/www/yourdirectory/jimbo.htm&quot;. 
          If you have trouble with accessing the default simple relative paths 
          included in the 'elistset.pl' file, try the absolute root reference 
          ie &quot;/web/yourdomain/cg-bin/counters/hitcount.t&quot; etc. If this 
          is still a problem, look in any installed scripts on your server for 
          a reference, or contact your hosting support staff and send them the 
          'elistset.pl' file.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b><i>NOTE</i></b>: 
          If you have problems, double check ALL permission's (below) before changing 
          the default paths, unless you know in advance what the paths should 
          be.</font></p>

          slightly between UNIX servers. If you have problems running the scripts, 
          check with your host support staff about the correct path described 
          in this line. The default entry is &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot; and another 
          common variation is &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. In Perl scripts 
          the hash sign &quot;<b>#</b>&quot; character comments out the code on 
          a line starting with this character. <b>Here it has a special meaning</b> 
          to Perl and MUST remain. Check with other installed scripts also if 
          you do not know what this line should look like.<br>
          <font color="#CC0000"><b>NOTE</b></font>: one path to perl MAY work

        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2"><b>SCRIPT and FILES

          Each list file must be given read and write permissions (chmod 666). 
          The directory that they are placed in will also have to have read and 
          write permissions. Either read and write chmod 766 (r+w) or possibly 
          chmod 777 (r+w+x) should work - try the first before the latter. The 
          other directories should also be given the same permissions as the mailists 
          directory.<br>
          &#149; a few servers will be set up to allow read/write via a default 
          manually created directory (even 755!)<br>
          &#149; a few servers will set a 766 value automatically to 777!<br>
          &#149; a very few servers have <u>strange</u> permissions options and 
          must be known via the hosts help pages.<br>
          &#149; NO programmer can remotely tell you exactly what permissions 
          will be required. Host engineers sometimes create their own ideas of 
          server/site dir and file permissions.</font></p>

          them. Should you have to use another directory, AND your server allows 
          the execution of Perl CGI scripts in other directories, then that directory 
          should be set with read and execute permissions - chmod 755 (r+x). <font color="#CC0000"><b>NOTE</b>:

        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">By far the biggest problems 
          faced when installing scripts are firstly the file transport encoding 
          used and secondly the permissions settings set for both files and new 
          directories. The 'AUTO&quot; function in most FTP programs should only

          format. (ALL E_LISTS FILES are ASCII text). </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">Failure to do this will 
          result in a server failing to recognise and execute the scripts. Although 
          often referred to as programs, scripts must be compiled before they 
          do anything. As an example, files with the .EXE extension on programs 
          that are installed on Wintel machines are pre-compiled binary executable 
          programs. Perl scripts on the other hand are compiled in memory by Perl 
          every time before they can be executed. The script (text) must be in 
          ASCII text format for the interpreter to be able to read it.</font></p>

          <b>NOTE</b>: To check the Sendmail path you need to change the programs

          the default (recommended) directories and file names for you, and set 
          the permissions. It is unprotected and there is no guarantee that it 
          will work; try it at your own risk (<i>disclaimer only</i>). It works 
          well on many sites and we also use it for all installations - <i>often 
          learn a bit about the site too</i>.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="2">Try installing and running this script 
          first. It will report success or failure when creating the files/directories 
          and prove the correctness of your Perl Path&quot;, plus indicate that 
          the default relative paths will work OK. If the default urls/paths are 
          not used, then you will have to change them first. IF nothing works 
          trying to create the cgi sub dirs, create them manually, note &quot;# 
          comments&quot; against dir names, and run again to then see if files 
          are created - good way to prove relative paths.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="2">To use it, make sure the &quot;Perl Path&quot; 
          at the top of the script is correct. <b><font color="#cc0000">NOTE</font></b>: 
          the default Sub-Directory permissions are set to 766. Change these values 
          to 777 if your site so requires BEFORE running the script. If running 
          the script is successful, you only have to FTP your supplied files over 
          the new empty ones. (note: for security reasons, makedir does NOT prepare 
          an empty file for the cgi scripts, you must upload them (as ascii) and
