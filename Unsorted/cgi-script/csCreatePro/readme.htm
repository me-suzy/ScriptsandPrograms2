        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">We offer professional installation but
        many people like to install their own applications or are behind a
        firewall that does not allow external access. Follow the instructions
        below and you should not have any trouble. If you  run into difficulty
        do not hesitate to ask for assistance.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Quick Install for Experienced
        Installers</b><br>
        <b>1.</b> Unzip the file and transfer the entire csCreatePro directory
        to a directory accessible from a web browser on your server. We suggest
        creating a directory called 'cgi-script' and then transferring the
        entire csCreatePro directory and contents from the zip file to this
        directory making sure all but the images are transfer in ASCII mode
        (images should be transferred in binary mode).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>2.</b> CHMOD csCreatePro.cgi to 777
        and then open the URL with your web browser. If all goes well, this will
        give you the auto-setup screen. Change the username and password if you
        so desire and click save. You should then see the login screen where you
        can enter the control panel and start using the script.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>NOTES</b><br>
        <b>1.</b> If you keep coming back to the install screen, then chances
        are your web server doesn't have write access to your directories.. You
        will need to CHMOD the csCreatePro directory and image_upload
        subdirectory to 777.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>2.</b> If you are unable to run
        scripts outside your cgi-bin directory then you will need to create a
        separate directory in your root directory and upload the images, icons,
        and image_upload directory and contents there. Then, you will need to
        modify the htmlurl and htmlpath variables to point to this new location.
        Also in this directory, place the following files: csCreatePro.css, selcolor.html,
        and help.html.</font></p>
        <p><b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Normal Installation Instructions</font></b><font size="2"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b><br>
        1.</b> Unzip the file and transfer to
        your server with the following directory structure:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">/cgi-script &lt;-- cgiscript.net

          should be located at<br>
          [root url]/cgi-script/csCreatePro/csCreatePro.cgi<br>
          where [root url]</font></font><font face="Courier New" size="2"> </font><font size="2"><font face="Courier New" size="2">is
          the URL to your website. Example:<br>
          http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/csCreatePro/csCreatePro.cgi</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>2.</b> CHMOD csCreatePro.cgi to
        executable (CHMOD 755). Ask your server administrator for assistance if
        required.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>3.</b> If your Perl executable is not
        located at /usr/bin/perl, edit</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
        </font><font size="2"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">the first line of
        csCreatePro.cgi
        to reflect the true location.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>4.</b> Run csCreatePro.cgi from your
        webrowser to initiate the auto-setup mode.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Example: http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/cs</font><font face="Tahoma">CreatePro/csCreatePro.cgi</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">When the script is run for the first
        time, it goes into setup mode. A setup screen will appear where you can
        verify and modify the setup variables. Most of the time, there will be
        no need to modify any of these variables except the username and
        password. Those control access to the control panel and you can change
        then to anything you desire.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma">When you click the save button on the
        installation screen, it should automatically create a file called
        setup.cgi which will look something like:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Courier New">$cgiurl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/demo/csCreatePro/csCreate.cgi';<br>
          $cgipath = '/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/demo';<br>
          $htmlurl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/demo/csCreatePro';<br>
          $htmlpath = '/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/demo/csCreatePro';<br>
          $rooturl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/';<br>
          $rootpath = '/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/';<br>
          $makebackups=1;<br>
          $username = 'demo';<br>
          $password = 'demo';<br>
          1;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Tahoma"><b>Note:</b> If you keep returning to the setup
        screen then your web server doesn't have the ability to write to your
        directories. If that is the case, a work-around is to CHMOD the
        csCreatePro
        and image_upload directory to 777. In addition, you'll need to CHMOD any
        file or directory to 777 that you want to manage with csCreatePro.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma"><b>Hint: </b>Deleting the setup.cgi file will
        trigger the script to go back into setup mode.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma"><b>Installing the script in your cgi-bin directory</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma">Due to the limitations of cgi-bin directories,
        you'll need to create 2 directories when installing the script in the
        cgi-bin directory. One directory inside cgi-bin that will contain the
        script and supporting files, and another directory outside the cgi-bin
        directory to contain the images. You will need to copy the images,
        image_upload, and icons directory to this newly created directory
        outside your cgi-bin directory and point the htmlurl and htmlpath
        variables in the setup.cgi file to this location. </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Also
        in this directory, place the following files: csCreatePro.css,
        selcolor.html, help.html and t_add_href.htm.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma">If you have any problems or questions with the
        installation, don't hesitate to email <a href="mailto:support@cgiscript.net">support@cgiscript.net</a>.
        We also offer installation services.</font></p>

        <b>Managing your WebPages</b><br>
        Once a page is in the csCreatePro database, you can edit, remove it,
        delete it, and give users the ability to edit it. When the page is in
        the list, you will see the appropriate links next to it for editing.
        Removing a file means to just remove it from csCreatePro. Deleting a
        file physically deletes the file from your server. Only use the delete
        function if you truly want to delete this file off your server.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>User Management</b><br>
        You can create new users or delete a selected user from csCreatePro with
        the appropriate buttons at the top of the management page. When you
        select the user in the dropdown box, it will show you a list of files
        they currently have access to edit. Additionally, their information will
        appear in the text fields where you can change any of the information
        (name, password, etc) and click the save changes button.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Assigning Pages to Users</b><br>
        Select the 'ALL' option in the user dropdown. You will see a list of all
        the files that are in the csCreatePro system. Find the file you want to
        give access to a particular user and click the 'Show Users' button. This
        will popup a window where you can add and remove users for that
        particular file.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Once a user has been created, they can
        log into csCreatePro with&nbsp; http://www.yourdomain.com/installdir/CSCreatePro.cgi?command=login where
