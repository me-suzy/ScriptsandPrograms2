BOOKMARK COUNTER
================
This script will count the number of times surfers click your "Bookmark My Site" button. It can be used on multiple pages so you know which page gets the most bookmarks, etc.

Note: The actual bookmark function will only work in Internet Explorer 4+, but the script will count ALL clicks regardless of browser type.

If you have any questions or comments, e-mail me: info@red-flavored.com


INSTRUCTIONS
===============
1.) Upload bookmark_counter.php and bookmark_counter.dat to your server. The .dat file should be an empty plain-text file and CHMOD 666 (or 777 if that doesn't work).

2.) Open the example.html page in your HTML editor and change the code to fit your site's title and URL. Once you've done this, copy and paste the code into your webpage.

3.) Save your page and upload it to the server. Test the script by clicking the bookmark button and make sure your site's title and URL are correct.

4.) To view your stats, go to:
http://yourdomain.com/bookmark_counter.php?action=showcount

You should now see the counter at 1, with your URL and today's date displayed below.
