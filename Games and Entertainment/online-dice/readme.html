<h1>Online Game Dice v. 1.05 - Readme</h1>
<p>Adding dice to your online game is easy. As long as you have a web site with PHP enabled, you just have to add this script and you're good to go. Just follow these simple instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download and unzip the Online Game Dice folder</li>
	<li>Copy the folder to your web site directory using your preferred method (FTP, for example).</li>
	<li>Edit the three variables in the config.php files with your favorite editor (Notepad, for instance).</li>
	<li>Include the file dice-include.php wherever you want to show the dice. The code is simple, just add <strong>&lt;?php include('online-dice/dice-include.php'); ?&gt;</strong>, if your web page is in the root directory.</li>
	<li>Make sure to save the file with a .php extension so that the include works properly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to take a look at the example file, example.php, for a demonstration of how to use the include.</p>
<h2>Dice Styles</h2>
