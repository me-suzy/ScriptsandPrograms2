 /-----------------\
 |  PHP-Post v1.0  |
 \-----------------/

Welcome to PHP-Post! This script allows you to add a forum to your site simply and quickly.

 /-----------------\
 | Getting started |
 \-----------------/

To start off using PHP-Post, upload everything from this zip file except the readme.txt and whatsnew.txt files to your server.

 /-----------------\
 |   Installing    |
 \-----------------/

Once it's uploaded, installation of the script takes only a few minutes. Browse to install.php in the folder where the forum is installed and you will see a page prompting you to enter your MySQL settings along with an administrator's username and password.

The MySQL details you will require are your server name (often localhost), MySQL username and password, and the database name. You may also change the prefix for the tables if you have multiple installations.

Do NOT lose your login details - without them you will be unable to update the forums or log in. Once they are entered and the forum set up, you can move to the main forums after deleting the install.php file from your server.

Be sure to go to the "setup" section first to finish setting up your forums.

 |    Problems?    |
 \-----------------/

Bear in mind this is an early version of the software, so there are likely still many bugs to be found. Don't use the script for anything "mission-critical", and if you find any problems at all or have any suggestions, please e-mail me: david@php-post.co.uk. Information on the script and the latest bugfixes can also be found on the website: www.php-post.co.uk
