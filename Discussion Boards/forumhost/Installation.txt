First things first...open config.php. :)

The first 4 variables are empty, and MUST be entered! These are for your MySQL
information. In order: Hostname, Login, Password, and Database name.

You should be able to tip-toe through the rest of the configuration variables
to see what they are. The script will work with these default values, but at
the very least change the $fhtitle and $fhurl variables. :) The other variables
have been commented to explain what they do.

Now save config.php, and upload all the files.

After uploading all the files and folders, you should have a folder called 'files'.
This is where image attachments are stored. You'll need to CHMOD this folder to 777.
If you never plan to enable image attachments, you won't have to worry about this. :)

Run the file create_tables.php through your web browser, and follow the
instructions on the page. This will create the MySQL tables needed
for ForumHost.

The index page, index.php, is just there as an example, and is NOT part of the script.
It's just a page to link to the signup page and members' area. You should replace this
page with one you've designed yourself. This will be the main site for your
Forum Hosting Service. However this page will suffice in the meantime till you've created one. :)

Thats it! ForumHost is set up, configured, and ready to go. ;)
