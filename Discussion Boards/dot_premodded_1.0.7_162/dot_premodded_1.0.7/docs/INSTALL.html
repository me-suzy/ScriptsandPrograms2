<a name="quickinstall"></a><h2 class="h2"><u>1. Quick Install</u></h2>

<p>If you have basic knowledge of using FTP and are sure your hosting service or server will run .premodded you can use these steps to quickly get started. For a more detailed explanation you should skip this and go to <a href="#require">section 2</a> below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Decompress the .premodded archive to a local directory on your system.</li>
<li>Upload all the files contained in this archive (retaining the directory structure) to a web accessible directory on your server or hosting account.
<li>Change the permissions on config.php to be writeable by all (666 or -rw-rw-rw- within your FTP Client)</li>
<li>Using your web browser visit the location you placed .premodded with the addition of install/install.php, e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/phpBB2/install/install.php, http://www.mydomain.com/forum/install/install.php etc.
<li>Fill out all the requested information and hit <i>Submit</i></li>
<li>Change the permissions on config.php to be writeable only by yourself (644 or -rw-r--r-- within your FTP Client)</li>
<li>Click the <i>Complete Installation</i> button or revisit the location you entered above.</li>
<li>.premodded should now be available, please <b>MAKE SURE</b> you read at least <a href="#postinstall">Section 8</a> below for important, security related post-installation instructions.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you experienced problems or do not know how to proceed with any of the steps above please read the rest of this document.</p>

<a name="require"></a><h2 class="h2"><u>2. Requirements</u></h2>

<p>Installation of .premodded requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A webserver or web hosting account running on any major Operating System</li>
<li>A MySQL database.
</li>
<li>PHP (3.0.9 and above or preferably a recent 4.x) with support for the database you intend to use above</li>
</ul>

<p>If your server or hosting account does not meet the requirements above I am afraid .premodded is not for you.</p>

<a name="install"></a><h2 class="h2"><u>3. New Installations</u></h2>

<p>Installation of .premodded will vary according to your server and database. If you have <i>shell access</i> to your account (via telnet or ssh for example) you may want to upload the entire .premodded archive (in binary mode!) to a directory on your host and unarchive it there.</p>

<p>If you do not have shell access or do not wish to use it you will need to decompress the .premodded archive to a local directory on your system using your favourite compression program, e.g. winzip, rar, zip, etc. From there you must FTP <b>ALL</b> the files it contains (being sure to retain the directory structure and filenames) to your host. Please ensure that the cases of filenames are retained, do <b>NOT</b> force filenames to all lower or upper case doing so will cause errors later.</p>

<p>All .php, .inc, .sql, .cfg and .htm files should be uploaded in <b>ASCII</b> mode, while all graphics should be uploaded in <b>BINARY</b> mode. If you are unfamiliar with what this means please refer to your FTP client documentation. In most cases this is all handled transparantly by your ftp client but if you encounter problems later you should be sure the files where uploaded correctly as described here.</p>

<p>phpBB2 comes supplied with English as its standard language. However a number of seperate packs for different languages are available. If you are not a native English speaker you may wish to install one or more of these packages before continuing. The installation process below will allow you to select a default language from those available (you can of course change this default at a later stage). For more details of language packs, where to obtain them and how to install them please see the <a href="README.html#i18n">README</a>.</p>

<p>Once all the files have been uploaded to your site you should point your browser at this location with the addition of install/install.php (please note that if you changed the extension from php, see <a href="#fileext">Section 3.i</a> below, you should alter install.php appropriately). For example if your domain name is <i>www.mydomain.tld</i> and you placed .premodded in a directory /phpBB2 off your web root you would enter <i>http://www.mydomain.tld/phpBB2/install/install.php</i> into your browser. When you have done this you should see the .premodded Installation screen appear.</p>

<a name="fileext"></a><h3 class="h3">3.i. Changing the file extension</h3>

<p>If the file extension used to execute PHP scripts on your server is <b>NOT</b> .php but for example .php3 or .phtml you should first rename <b>ALL</b> files ending in .php and change the value of $phpEx in <u>extension.inc</u>. In the vast majority of cases this step will be unncessary.</p>

<a name="nonaccess"></a><h3 class="h3">3.ii. Installing on MySQL 3 and 4.</h3>

<p><b>Before proceeding</b> with installation you should ensure you have a database available. Most good hosting accounts now come with at least one database as part of the basic package although it may need to be setup before first use. Ask your provider for details if you are unsure whether you do or not. If you are running your own server and are unsure how to create a database you should refer to your SQL servers documentation or website, e.g. <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/" target="_new">http://www.mysql.com/doc/</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure you select the appropriate version from the dropdown box. Do <b>NOT</b> select MySQL 4.x if you have MySQL 3.x (the most common type) installed, if in doubt select MySQL 3.x.</p>

<a name="requireddata"></a><h3 class="h3">3.iii. Entering required data</h3>

<p>Once you have reached the installation page you need to fill out several fields. Be sure to select the right <u>database type</u>! If you do not have or do not know the <u>database name</u>, <u>database server</u>, etc. please check with your hosting provider.</p>

<p>The <u>database prefix</u> allows you to enter a few characters, short name, etc. which all tables used by this installation will be prefixed with. The default (phpbb_) will usually be fine. However if you have more than one copy of .premodded using the same database be sure to alter it or you will receive errors during installation.</p>

<p>The remaining information is personal to you and your site. You will need to enter a <u>username</u> and <u>password</u> for the initial administration account (more administrators can be created later). The <u>server name</u>, <u>server port</u> and <u>script path</u> are essential because all emails containing URLs will use these values. The installer will guess initial values, however they may not be correct so be sure to check them!</p>

<p>Remember that a domain (or server) name does <b>NOT</b> include http://! Enter just the domain name, eg. <i>www.mydomain.tld</i> and <b>NOT</b> <i>http://www.mydomain.tld/</i>. The server port can, in the great majority of cases be left as 80, this is the standard http port. However if your web server listens to a different port because for example port 80 is blocked then alter this appropriately. The script path is the relative path from your webroot where .premodded is installed, e.g. if you install .premodded into premodded/ in your webroot then enter premodded (or /premodded/) as the script path.</p>

<a name="completeinstall"></a><h3 class="h3">3.iv. Completing installation</h3>

<p>Once you have checked all the data press submit. The installation script will create and populate all the necessary tables. It will then attempt to write to the <u>config.php</u> file which will contain the basic configuration data used to run .premodded. If the installer cannot write <u>config.php</u> directly you will be given the option of either downloading the file or even FTPing it to the correct location. If you choose to download you should then re-upload the file to your server, overwriting the existing <u>config.php</u> in the process. If you attempt to FTP via the install script you should supply the requested information. Should FTP fail you will be able to download the file and then re-upload as described earlier.</p>

<p>During the installation procedure .premodded will check to ensure the relevant PHP database module is available and will not proceed if it cannot be found. Should this happen be sure to check you have selected the correct database and/or ask your hosting provider for advice.</p>

<p><b>Do not</b> proceed untill the installation is completed and (if necessary) you have uploaded the <u>config.php</u> file.</p>

<a name="avatars"></a><h3 class="h3">4.i. Uploadable avatars</h3>

<p>.premodded supports several methods for allowing users to select their own <i>avatar</i> (an avatar is a small image generally unique to a user and displayed just below their username in posts).</p>

<p>Two of these options allow users to upload an avatar from their machine or a remote location (via a URL). If you wish to enable this function you should first ensure the correct paths for uploadeable avatars is set in Admin -> General -> Configuration -> Avatars. By default this is <u>images/avatars</u> but you can set it to whatever you like, just ensure the configuration setting is updated. You must also ensure this directory can be written to by the webserver. Usually this means you have to alter its permissions to allow anyone to read and write to. Exactly how you should do this depends on your ftp client or server operating system.</p>

<p>On UNIX systems for example you set the directory to a+rwx (or ugo+rwx or even 777). This can be done from a command line on your server using chmod or via your FTP client (using the Change Permissions, chmod or other Permissions dialoge box, see your FTP clients documentation for help). Most FTP clients list permissions in the form of User (Read, Write, Execute), Group (Read, Write, Execute) and Other (Read, Write, Execute). You need to tick all of these boxes to set correct permissions.</p>

<p>On Windows system you need to ensure the directory is not write-protected and that it has global write permissions (see your servers documentation or contact your hosting provider if you are unsure on how to achieve this).</p>

<p>Please be aware that setting a directories permissions to global write access is a potential security issue. While it is unlikely that anything nasty will occur (such as all the avatars being deleted) there are always people out there out to cause trouble. Therefore you should monitor this directory and if possible make regular backups.</p>

<a name="safemode"></a><h3 class="h3">4.ii. Safe Mode</h3>

<p>.premodded includes support for using uploadable avatars on systems running PHP in safe mode. If this applies to your hosting service you will need to create a sub-directory called <u>tmp</u> in the directory you specified for storage of uploaded avatars (by default this is images/avatars as explained above). Give it the same access rights as for uploadable avatars above.</p>

<p>This safe mode support includes compatibility with various directory restrictions your host may impose (assuming they are not too restrictive and that the PHP installed is version 4.0.3 or later). There is generally no need for any manual setup for safe mode support it is typically handled transparantly.</p>

<a name="extras"></a><h3 class="h3">4.iii. Optional extras</h3>

<p>Included with this package are two extra (optional) files, you will find them in the <u>contrib/</u> directory. These extras, <i>template_file_cache.php</i> and <i>template_db_cache.php</i> address concerns over server load and page generation times on slower or heavily loaded systems. These updated template modules compile each template and uses this rather than compiling each file everytime it is viewed. Tests seem to indicate a noticeable decrease in page generation times and more importantly a significant decrease in overall server load in virtual hosting environments.</p>

<p>You should see the <a href="../contrib/README.html">README</a> contained within the contrib directory for more details.</p>
