Author Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The function was included in a seperate php file to allow people to easily
use the link checking capability to their liking. The other two files
example_linkcheck.php and linkcheck.php are just demonstrations of the use
for the function. Also note that the function for retrieve page data was
taken directly from www.php.net
